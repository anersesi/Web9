\page InstallUnix Install using the command line (Mac/Unix)

This topic describes how to install and configure the \c SKIRT code using the command line, i.e. without employing
any graphical user interfaces. While this approach may seem challenging to some, it involves the smallest number of
dependencies, lowering the complexity and the risk of failure. The instructions in this topic should be applicable to
any Unix-based system, including Mac OS X, Linux distributions, and other Unix flavors.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallUnixTools
- \ref InstallUnixGet
- \ref InstallUnixBuild
- \ref InstallUnixResource
- \ref InstallUnixFinal


\section InstallUnixTools Install the build tools (Mac/Unix)

\subsection InstallUnixToolsVersions Versions

The precise operating system version is not so important, as long as it supports 64-bit applications and you can
install sufficiently recent versions of the build tools (which may be easier on more recent
operating system versions):

- A recent C++ compiler with full support for the C++14 standard:
  - On Mac OS X, use Apple Clang v10 (included in Xcode v10) or later.
  - On other Unix systems, use GNU g++ v5.4.0 or later or Intel icc v19.0.2 or later.
- CMake v3.2.2 or later.


\subsection InstallUnixToolsMac Mac OS X

On Mac OS X the C++ compiler and \em git command line tools are provided as part of the Xcode development environment,
which is freely available from the App Store. Download and install the latest version, and then launch the Xcode
application at least once to complete the installation of the command line tools.

Verify that the installed compiler has an appropriate version (see \ref InstallUnixToolsVersions) by opening a Terminal
window and entering the following command:

\verbatim
$ clang++ --version
Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)
...
\endverbatim

Download the most recent CMake for Mac OS X (as a disk image or ".dmg" file) from https://cmake.org/download/ and
perform the installation by opening the disk image and dragging "CMake.app" to the Application folder. Then edit your
login script (<tt>.profile</tt> or <tt>.bash_profile</tt> or equivalent if you are using a shell other than \c bash)
to add the cmake command residing inside "CMake.app" to your system path. For example, add the following line:

\verbatim
export PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:${PATH}"
\endverbatim

\note On Mac, the <tt>.profile</tt> script is not loaded when there is a <tt>.bash_profile</tt> in your home directory.

Open a new Terminal window (so that the new login script gets loaded) and verify that the installed build tool
has an appropriate version (see \ref InstallUnixToolsVersions) by entering the following command:

\verbatim
$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.5.1
...
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallUnixToolsUbuntu Ubuntu

On Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, you can use <tt>apt-get</tt> to obtain the required tools. Open a
Terminal window and enter the commands listed below.

\verbatim
$ sudo apt-get update
...
$ sudo apt-get install git
...
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
...
$ sudo apt-get install g++
...
\endverbatim

These commands require root access to modify files in the system directories. The "sudo" command takes care of this
assuming that the corresponding privileges are enabled for your account. Enter your password (\em not the root
password!) when asked. Also, for each command, you will be prompted with the question "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]".
Respond affirmative unless you see a good reason not to.

Once the above commands have completed successfully, verify that the installed tools have an appropriate version (see
\ref InstallUnixToolsVersions) by entering the following commands:

\verbatim
$ g++ --version"
g++ (GCC) 5.4.0
...
$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.5.1
...
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallUnixToolsModule Systems using modules

Large multi-node computing systems often use a \em module system that allows \em loading
a particular subset or version of the tools installed on the system. Contact your system administrator for details.
For example, to load the tools for building the \c SKIRT code one might issue commands like these:

\verbatim
$ module load cmake
$ module load intel_comp/2019-update2
$ icc --version
icc (ICC) 19.0.2.187 20190117
...
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallUnixToolsOther Other Unix systems

Other Unix systems might support variations on or combination of these methods to install the required tools:
 - Use the standard package manager for your system.
 - Download and run an installer manually.
 - Load the appropriate module.
 - Ask your system manager.


\section InstallUnixGet Get the source code (Mac/Unix)

To install the \c SKIRT code you need to copy the source code to your local file system. First create a directory
hierarchy that will hold the source code, binaries and runtime information. The top-level directory can have any name
(for example \c SKIRT) and can be located anywhere, but the subdirectories should be named as indicated below. Execute
the following commands in a Terminal window to create the \c SKIRT directory in your home directory.

    cd
    mkdir SKIRT
    cd SKIRT
    mkdir release run git

You now need to create a local repository (\em local meaning "on your own computer") by cloning (i.e. copying) the
online <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT9">public \c SKIRT GitHub repository</a> hosted at
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>. While everyone can read or copy from this repository, only the core
\c SKIRT team can write to it. As a result, two situations present themselves.
If you don't plan to modify the \c SKIRT code, or any modifications will be kept local to your computer, then you can
clone your local copy directly from the main \c SKIRT repository. To achieve this, enter the following commands in a
Terminal window:

    cd ~/SKIRT
    git clone https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT9.git git

To update your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    git pull

On the other hand, if you plan to modify or extend the \c SKIRT code more extensively, you might want to share your
changes with other computer systems. For example, you may need to synchronize the code between your development machine
and a remote server on which you actually run the simulations. Or, you may consider contributing your changes to the
main project once they have been fleshed out and tested. In these cases, you should first create a personal fork of the
\c SKIRT project on GitHub, and then clone that fork to your computer(s). For more information about forking, refer to
the [GitHub fork help item](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-forks). For more information about contributing
to the \c SKIRT project, see the [Contributing](../root/_Contributing.html) section on this web site.


\section InstallUnixBuild Configure and build the code (Mac/Unix)

\subsection InstallUnixBuildFirst Building for the first time

The \c SKIRT code code includes two \c bash shell scripts to help configuring and building \c SKIRT
from the source code in the git directory. Before you use these script for the first time, you may need
to make them executable:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    chmod +rx configSKIRT.sh
    chmod +rx makeSKIRT.sh

To build \c SKIRT for the first time, using default build options, enter the following commands:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    ./makeSKIRT.sh

If all goes well, you should see output similar to this:

\verbatim
Using /usr/bin/cmake to generate build files

...

\endverbatim

If things do not go so well, you'll need to take corrective action depending on the problem. The table below
provides some hints; if the problem persists please contact the core \c SKIRT team.

<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Problem</TH>  <TH>Cause and corrective action</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>There is no cmake in the default path</TD>
    <TD>The \c CMake build tool is not installed, or its location has not been added to the default system PATH;
        see \ref InstallUnixTools</TD> </TR>
<TR><TD>CMake version is too old</TD>
    <TD>The default system PATH points to an older version of the \c CMake build tool; verify the installation
        with "which cmake" and "cmake --version"</TD> </TR>
<TR><TD>No compiler is found, or compiler identification is not what you expected</TD>
    <TD>\c CMake looks for compilers in the default system PATH in some complicated order, it might find an old
        compiler version, or it might choose the GNU compiler while you want to use the Intel compiler;
        in this case explicitly specify the compiler; see \ref InstallUnixBuildSelectComp</TD> </TR>
<TR><TD>Compiler reports an error on one or more source files</TD>
    <TD>Verify that your compiler version fully supports C++14; see \ref InstallUnixToolsVersions.
        If the compiler is sufficiently recent, there might be a platform-specific issue with the code.</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>

\subsection InstallUnixBuildSelectComp Selecting the compiler

If the compiler identification listed at the start of the \c makeSKIRT procedure does not match your expectations,
or no compiler is found at all, you need to specify the compiler explicitly through the \c configSKIRT script.

The first step is to figure out the full absolute path of the appropriate compiler executable. Sometimes this is easy.
For example, on systems that have the Intel compiler installed in addition to the GNU compiler, \c CMake will often
select the GNU compiler while you may want it to use the Intel compiler. To discover the path of the Intel compiler,
enter the command "which icc". In other cases, you may need to browse around on your file system to locate the
compiler executable.

Once you have the compiler path, you can resolve the problem by entering the following commands, where you replace
\<path\> by the full absolute path of the compiler executable:

\verbatim
cd ~/SKIRT/git
./configSKIRT.sh CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path> CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path>
./makeSKIRT.sh
\endverbatim

This should cause \c CMake to select the specified compiler and list the corresponding compiler identification.

\parblock
\note You need to configure both the plain C compiler and the C++ compiler. In many cases you can use the
same path (most modern compilers automatically deduce the correct language flavor), but sometimes you need to
provide the appropriate path for each compiler separately.
\endparblock

\parblock
\note The \c CMake configuration state is stored in the \c SKIRT/release directory so that it is persistent between
consecutive builds. Usually this is a good thing. However, fundamental changes to the configuration (such as specifying
another compiler) sometimes do not properly clear the previous state. When making such changes, it is wise to manually
clear the state by removing the complete contents of the \c SKIRT/release directory, and performing \c configSKIRT
again with the appropriate options.
\endparblock

\subsection InstallUnixBuildOptions Adjusting build options

By default, the procedure described above builds just the \c SKIRT command line program. To build optional programs
or to enable capabilities such as multi-processing, you need to adjust the corresponding
build options through the \c configureSKIRT script. For a list of build options, see \ref InstallOptions.

For example, to also build the documentation streamliner used by \c SKIRT developers,
enter the following command (still in the \c git directory):

    ./configSKIRT.sh BUILD_DOX_STYLE=ON

In some cases, you need to repeat this process. New options may appear because you enabled the option on which they
depend. To adjust such dependent options, you need a second round of performing \c configureSKIRT.


\section InstallUnixResource Download the SKIRT resource files (Mac/Unix)

Because of size limitations in GitHub repositories, the resource data files needed by the \c SKIRT code are hosted
elsewhere (on the Ghent University science faculty data server) and must be downloaded separately. The resource files
are organized in \em resource \em packs, i.e. ZIP archives containing related resource data. The "Core" resource pack
is required for the basic operation of \c SKIRT; other resource packs are optional and must be installed only if the
corresponding \c SKIRT functionality is actually being used. The \c SKIRT source code repository \em does contain a
list of the names and version numbers of the resource packs that should (or could) be downloaded. The shell script \c
downloadResources.sh uses this list to help download and install each of the expected resource packs.

The download script can be invoked by entering the following commands:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    ./downloadResources.sh

The script will ask confirmation before starting the download of a resource pack that has not yet been installed:

    Do you want to download and install SKIRT9_Resources_Core version 1? [y/n] yes

Always answer "yes" for the "Core" resource pack (you can skip the other resource packs; you can download them later
simply by running the script again). You will then see a log similar to the following:

    Downloading SKIRT9_Resources_Core_v1.zip ...
    ...
    Archive:  SKIRT9_Resources_Core_v1.zip
      inflating: SKIRT9_Resources_Core/version.txt
      inflating: SKIRT9_Resources_Core/history.txt
      inflating: SKIRT9_Resources_Core/Band/GENERIC_JOHNSON_B_BroadBand.stab
      ....
      inflating: SKIRT9_Resources_Core/SingleGrain/MeanPascucciBenchmarkOpticalProps.stab
    ------------------------------------------------

After downloading, the resource files are extracted from the archive and placed in a subdirectory of the \c
SKIRT/resources directory, next to your \c SKIRT/git directory. The file \c history.txt inside that subdirectory
offers brief historical release notes for the corresponding resource pack.


\section InstallUnixFinal Finalize the installation (Mac/Unix)

To provide easy access to the executables in the \c SKIRT code, edit your login script (<tt>.profile</tt> or
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or equivalent if you are using a shell other than \c bash) to add the appropriate \c SKIRT
executable paths to your system path. For example, add the following line:

\verbatim
export PATH="${HOME}/SKIRT/release/SKIRT/main:${PATH}"
\endverbatim

\note On Mac, the <tt>.profile</tt> script is not loaded when there is a <tt>.bash_profile</tt> in your home directory.

To verify your installation of the \c SKIRT code, close all Terminal windows and launch a new one, so that your
updated login script gets executed. Enter the command "skirt" without any command-line arguments. If the \c SKIRT
code has been successfully installed, you should see output similar to this:

\verbatim
$ skirt
14/05/2019 14:57:20.909   Welcome to SKIRT v9.0 (git 3e676b3 built on 14/05/2019 at 14:57:10)
14/05/2019 14:57:20.909   Running on obiwan.ugent.be for pcamps
14/05/2019 14:57:20.909   Interactively constructing a simulation...
14/05/2019 14:57:20.909 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created:
\endverbatim

You can follow the instructions in the Terminal window to create a \c SKIRT parameter file or press [CTRL] + C to exit
the program. For more information on using \c SKIRT, please refer to the \ref UserGuide.
