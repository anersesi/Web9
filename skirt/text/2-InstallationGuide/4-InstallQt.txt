\page InstallQt Install using Qt Creator (all platforms)

You may wish to install the Qt development environment (although the \c SKIRT command line program does
not depend on it), so that you can use the graphical user interface offered by the optional \c MakeUp utility for
configuring parameter files. Apart from this, Qt Creator is an excellent C++ source code editor and build environment.
So you can just as well use it to configure and build the \c SKIRT code.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallQtToolsGet
- \ref InstallQtInstall
- \ref InstallQtBuild
- \ref InstallQtFinal


\section InstallQtToolsGet Install the build tools and get the source code (Qt Creator)

As a first step, you need to install the basic build tools (\c git, \c CMake, and C++ compiler) and obtain a local copy
of the \c SKIRT source code, just like you would if you were not using Qt. Follow the instructions appropriate
for your operating system:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
- \ref InstallUnixTools
- \ref InstallUnixGet
</TD><TD>
- \ref InstallWindowsTools
- \ref InstallWindowsGet
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

There is no need to configure and build the \c SKIRT code according to the platform-specific instructions, because
that will be accomplished with Qt Creator as described below.


\section InstallQtInstall Install the development environment (Qt Creator)

The \c MakeUp program that is part of the \c SKIRT project requires Qt Desktop v5.9.0 or later.

In addition to cross-platform run-time libraries, the Qt development environment includes a convenient integrated code
editor/builder called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed with a single installer.

<b> Download the installer </b>

  - Go to the <a href="https://www.qt.io/download">Qt download page</a>.
  - Follow the "Go open source" button.
  - If the web site properly identified your operating system, press "Download" and wait for the installer
    to be downloaded.
  - Otherwise, press "View other options" and download an installer appropriate for your system. Select an
    online installer unless you have a good reason to use an offline installer.

<b> Open the installer </b>

  - Launch the installer you just downloaded. The precise procedure will differ depending on your operating system:
    - On Mac OS X, double click the downloaded disk image file ('.dmg") to mount the disk, and then
      double-click the installer in the newly opened window. You will get a warning that the program was downloaded
      from the internet, but you can click 'Open' anyway since this source can be trusted.
    - On Windows, respond "yes" when your browser asks whether
      to actually execute the downloaded executable file, or simply double click the file.
    - On Linux, you need to make the downloaded file executable and then launch it from the command line, e.g.:

          cd Downloads
          chmod +rx qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
          ./qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run

<b> Select the components to be installed </b>

  - Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the installation. You can skip creating a Qt account unless you want
    to. You will also be asked to choose the installation folder for Qt; it is best to keep this at the default value.

  - When you enter the "Select Components" screen, select a recent release, and unfold the item that is marked as
    the Qt version to be installed. In the list that appears, uncheck all items except the one corresponding to
    your desktop operating system (e.g. "macOS" or "Desktop").

  - Press continue and follow the subsequent steps until the actual installation starts.

<b> Make a shortcut to Qt Creator </b>

  - At the end of the installation, you can choose to open Qt Creator. This gives you an opportunity for creating a
    permanent shortcut to Qt Creator in your dock or task bar. Right-click the application icon in the dock or task bar
    and select "Lock" in the popup menu (or equivalent operation depending on your operating system).

  - Alternatively, locate the Qt Creator application in the newly installed directory, and drag the application icon to
    your dock or task bar (or equivalent operation depending on your operating system).

<b> Configure the build tools in Qt Creator </b>

  - Open Qt Creator if needed.

  - Show the Qt Creator preferences panel (depending on your operating system, choose the menu item
    "Qt Creator -> Preferences..." or "Tools->Options...").

  - Select the "Kits->CMake" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the correct version of CMake installed
    on your computer. If not, manually add it to the list. <b>Important note for Mac OS X</b>: configure the command
    line version of cmake that resides \em inside the <b>CMake.app</b> directory, i.e.
    <tt>/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake</tt>, rather than the <tt>CMake.app</tt> GUI application itself.

  - Select the "Kits->Compilers" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the compilers installed on your
    computer. If not, manually add a suitable C and C++ compiler.

  - Select the "Kits->Qt Versions" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the Qt version you just installed.
    If not, manually add an appropriate Qt version.

  - Select the "Kits->Kits" tab. Usually there is only a single kit called "Desktop xxxx (Default)". If there are
    muliple kits, verify that the appropriate kit is marked as "Default". Verify and if needed configure the properties
    of the default kit, specifically "Compiler", "Qt version" and "CMake Tool". The "CMake Generator" property should
    be set to "Code Blocks - Unix Makefiles ..."

  - Press "OK" to accept any changes and close the preferences panel.

<b> Install system libraries if required </b>

On some Unix systems other than Mac OS X, the Qt libraries used by the optional \c MakeUp tool in the \c SKIRT project
depend on extra system libraries. On Ubuntu these libraries can be installed as follows:

    sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev


\section InstallQtBuild Configure and build the code (Qt Creator)

\subsection InstallQtBuildFirst Building for the first time

<b>Open the project file</b>

- Open Qt Creator.
- Choose the menu item "File->Open File or Project...".
- From within the dialog, locate and select the file \c CMakeLists.txt in your \c SKIRT/git directory
  (at the top level, \em not in one of the subdirectories).
- Press the "Open" button in the dialog.

Qt Creator now displays an initial configuration pane for the \c SKIRT project in its main window, similar to this:

\image html InstallQtConfigureProject.png

<b>Configure builds for the project</b>

In the configuration pane shown above:

- Uncheck all kits except for the kit you want to use (most likely, just your default kit is being shown).
- Open the details for that kit, and uncheck all build types except for "Debug" and "Release".
- Change the build paths to \c ~/SKIRT/debug and \c ~/SKIRT/release, respectively.
- Press the "Configure Project..." button, which causes Qt Creator to switch to regular "Edit" mode.

<b>Build the project</b>

- Select "Edit" mode in the left margin of the Qt Creator window, unless that mode is already shown.
- Click on the icon resembling a computer screen near the bottom of the left margin of the Qt Creator window
  to bring up a popup pane listing the various builds configured for your project.
- In that popup pane, select the "Release" build and the "skirt" run configuration.
- Click the hammer icon in the lower left corner of the Qt Creator window to compile and build the \c SKIRT project
  with the current build options.
- Select the "Compile Output" tab at the bottom of the Qt Creator window to view the build log.

Your window should now look similar to this:

\image html InstallQtEditBuild.png


\subsection InstallQtBuildOptions Adjusting build options

By default, the procedure described above builds just the \c SKIRT command line program. To build additional programs
such as \c MakeUp, or to enable capabilities such as multi-processing, you need to adjust the corresponding
build options. For a list of build options, see \ref InstallOptions.

Qt Creator offers built-in support for configuring build options and passing them on to the \c CMake build tool. To use
this feature, select the "Projects" mode in the left margin of the Qt Creator window, and then select the "Build" item
in the lefthand column of the window, just below a "Desktop" header stating your Qt and compiler versions. Your window
should now look similar to this:

\image html InstallQtBuildSettings.png

In this window, Qt Creator shows a list of \c CMake variables that control the build.

  - Use the checkboxes or the "Edit" button to adjust one or more values in the list. For example, to build the
    \c MakeUp utility, enable the checkbox next to the BUILD_MAKE_UP option.

  - Press the wide "Apply Configuration Changes" button at the bottom of the list. This causes the changes to be
    integrated into the \c CMake configuration, and the list of variables shown to be updated accordingly.

  - In some cases, you need to repeat this process:
     - A new option may appear because you enabled the options on which it depends. To adjust such dependent options,
       you need a second round of adjustment.
     - \c CMake may fail to locate the appropriate paths for an option you enabled. If so, you need another
       round of adjustment to override these values manually.

  - After all changes to the configuration have been applied, go back to "Edit" mode and press the Hammer icon to
    (re)build the code.


\section InstallQtFinal Finalize the installation (Qt Creator)

As the last step, you need to finalize and verify your installation just like you would if you were not using Qt.
Follow the instructions appropriate for your operating system:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
- \ref InstallUnixResource
- \ref InstallUnixFinal
</TD><TD>
- \ref InstallWindowsResource
- \ref InstallWindowsFinal
</TD></TR>
