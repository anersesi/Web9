\section DevCodingDesign Design principles

\subsection DevCodingDesignDepend Language, platforms and dependencies

The \c SKIRT code is written in standard C++14 and uses the CMake build system. The standard facilities of the C++14
language and run-time library may be used in full, within the guidance provided here. By and large, the code is fully
cross-platform and there are no external dependencies other those on the standard C++14 run-time library. The only
exceptions to this rule are:

 - The implementation of the System class (\em not its interface!), which contains any and all platform-specific code.
   This code may depend on platform-specific headers and functions that are always present for the target system. The
   platform-specific code portions are guarded by appropriate conditional compilation directives.

 - The ProcessManager class, which contains any calls to the optional message passing interface (MPI) library if the
   code is built with support for multi-processing. Again, the MPI-specific code portions are guarded by conditional
   compilation directives.

\subsection DevCodingDesignInter Internationalization

The user interface, implementation and documentation are written in US English
without any consideration towards internationalization (except for Unicode compatibility, see below).
This design choice substantially simplifies the implementation, for example in the following areas:
  - human readable descriptions loaded from configuration files;
  - hardcoded strings for labels and other user interface elements;
  - calculated strings, obtained by combining string segments or switching to uppercase at the start of a sentence.

Outside of the System class implementation, all strings are represented as UTF-8 encoded \c std::string objects.
UTF-8 encoded strings are fully compatible with 7-bit ASCII strings and can represent any Unicode code point
through multi-byte sequences (with the most significant bit set to 1). The System class provides appropriate
interfaces to obtain command line arguments, open a file for input or output, and read from or write to the
console. The implementation of these functions converts the internal UTF-8 encoding to and from the encoding
appropriate for the current system.

\subsection DevCodingDesignThread Thread safety

Unless otherwise noted in the class and/or method documentation, all code is either re-entrant or thread-safe.
Specifically, there are no global (static) variables except for representing truly global system resources
such as the console or a set of resource files. In those cases, initializing and updating the global variable occurs
in a critical section to ensure thread safety.

\section DevCodingStyle Coding style

To improve readability and maintainablity, it is important to use a consistent style across the code.

\subsection DevCodingStyleFiles Files and classes

Each C++ class (or namespace) is contained in its own .hpp and .cpp files, both named for the class.
Each of these files starts with the standard license template provided as part of the documentation.
Function implementations in a .cpp file are seperated by a line of forward slashes as wide as the license template.

Combining additional classes in the same header or source file is permissible only in extraordinary circumstances.
For example, a private utility class, used only from within a single class, may sometimes meaningfully be
placed inside the implementation of the client class.

Private variables, functions and classes that are not declared inside a class declaration in the header file,
are placed inside an anonymous namespace in the .cpp file, rather than declaring them in the global namespace.

\subsection DevCodingStylePrepro Preprocessor directives

Except as indicated below, preprocessor directives are not used other than for providing standard header
guards and for including headers. Specifically, there are no conditional compilation directives and no macro or
constant definitions.

The exceptions to this rule are:
 - The ItemInfo.hpp header and its users, which employ macro definitions to generate the code and metadata related to
   discoverable SMILE properties.
 - The implementation of the System class, which uses conditional compilation for adjusting to the current host system.
 - The implementation (\em not the interface) of a very small number of classes that support build-time options
   through conditional compilation. For example, the ProcessManager class
   is implemented differently when the code is built with support for MPI.

Unnecessary \#include directives are avoided, especially in header files because their inclusion propagates
dependencies and increases compilation time. Where possible, a forward class declaration is used in the header file
and the \#include directive is placed in the implementation file.

\#include directives are placed in the beginning of each file as a single block, i.e. without any intervening empty
lines. They are sorted automatically by the source code formatter, see \ref DevCodingStyleFormat.

Forward class declarations are placed just after the \#include directives, and they are sorted alphabetically.

\subsection DevCodingStyleUsing 'using' directives and declarations

The Basics header file is included directly or indirectly in all program units. This header includes the headers for
some frequently-used standard library facilities. In addition, it copies the types \c std::string and \c std::vector,
and the functions \c std::abs, \c std::min, and \c std::max to the global namespace so that the \c std prefix can be
omitted.

Other than these exceptions, \c using \c namespace directives or \c using declarations are not allowed in a global
scope. In most cases, it is best to use explicit namespace prefixes (i.e. \c std for the standard library). However, if
desired, \c using \c namespace directives or \c using declarations are allowed in a local scope (i.e. within a function
or a namespace).

\subsection DevCodingStyleNames Naming conventions

The code adheres to the following naming conventions:
  - all names are in camel case, i.e. each new word starts with a capital, as in \c localVariable or \c MyDerivedClass
  - class names and enumeration values start with an uppercase letter
  - function and variable names start with a lowercase letter
  - the names of class data members (variables declared as part of a class) have an underscore prefix, as in \c _x
  - the names of variables with thread_local scope have a \c t_ prefix, as in \c t_cell
  - getters and setters are named for the property: \c _property leads to \c property() and \c setProperty()
  - function names other than getters usually start with a verb, as in \c createPackage() or \c run()
  - preprocessor macro names (used only in exceptional cases) have all-uppercase names, as in \c ITEM_PROPERTY

\subsection DevCodingStyleDataMem Data members

All data members of a class are declared with private access only (rather than protected or public). If the information
represented by a data member must be accessed outside the class (including any derived classes), the relevant getters
or setters are provided with protected or public access. This restriction makes it a lot easier to locate all uses of
(and especially all potential modifications to) the value of a data member. If performance is a concern, the
implementation for trivial getters and setters may be included inline in the class definition (i.e. in the .hpp file).

For each data member of a class, default initialization is provided in the class definition (i.e. in the .hpp file)
with the declaration of the data member. For objects of a user-defined type (i.e. a proper class), including most
standard-library types such as strings and containers, default construction is usually sufficient. For primitive data
types, the C++14 braces or equal sign syntax is used to provide default initialization. A constructor of the class can
override the initialization of one or more data members, but there is no need to repeat the default initalization.

\subsection DevCodingStyleFormat Formatting the code

<b> C++ source code </b>

All C++ code in the \c SKIRT repository has been automatically formatted by the \c clang-format tool (version 9). The
formatting conventions are defined in a configuration file residing in the \c SKIRT build tree. For example, all lines
of code and comments are kept within a 120 character limit, indentation is used for readability, and curly braces
starting and ending a nesting level are usually placed on a line of their own. Newly submitted code must adhere to all
formatting conventions. This is verified by an automated procedure on GitHub.

The best (and often the only) way to ensure the correct result is to perform automated formatting before submission.
Assuming you have installed the \c clang-format tool (see \ref InstallDevClangFormat) and you configured Qt Creator for
using it (see \ref InstallDevQtFormat), you can automatically format the C++ source code in a given file as follows:

  - select the source file in a Qt Creator editor pane
  - save any changes to the file
  - choose the "Tools->External->Formatting->Format C++ code in file" menu item \em or use the keyboard shortcut
    assigned to this menu item: <tt>[Alt] + [Cmd] + [J]</tt> (on Mac) or <tt>[Alt] + [Ctrl] + [J]</tt> (on Linux).

Alternatively, you can run the \c formatSourceCode.sh shell script to format all C++ source code in your local branch
of the \c SKIRT repository:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    ./formatSourceCode.sh

<b> Comment blocks </b>

In .cpp files regular //-style comments are used for annotating the implementation. In .hpp files /**-style
Doxygen documentation blocks are used to document the code. These structured comments are used to
generate HTML formatted documentation (see \ref DevDocs).

Assuming you built the \c doxstyle tool (see \ref InstallDevDoxstyle) and you configured Qt Creator for using it (see
\ref InstallDevQtFormat), you can automatically reformat documentation blocks in the Qt Creator editor as follows:

 - select a section of code that contains one or more "/ **"-style documentation blocks (you may select regular code
   as well, possibly even the whole file)
 - choose the "Tools->External->Formatting->Format comments in selection" menu item \em or use the keyboard shortcut
   assigned to this menu item: <tt>[Alt] + [Cmd] + [I]</tt> (on Mac) or <tt>[Alt] + [Ctrl] + [I]</tt> (on Linux)


\section DevCodingLang Language recommendations

This section bundles further recommendations on using some of the C++ language facilities.

\subsection DevCodingLangInit Initialization

Declare variables only just before they are used, and provide initialization as part of the declaration
(or at least on the next line, for example when reading information from a stream).

Initialize data members to a default value as part of their declaration in the class definition.
If a constructor  sets the data member to another value, use the member initialization list rather than the
body of the constructor wherever possible.

\subsection DevCodingLangConsEnum Constants and enumerations

Constant objects or data structures with static allocation are best defined inside an anonymous namespace in a .cpp
file using a declaration that starts with the \c constexpr keyword (and does \em not include the \c static keyword).

Constant integer values part of a public interface are best defined as a scoped enumeration (\c enum \c class).
Always use scoped enumerations (\c enum \c class) rather than unscoped enumerations (\c enum).

Member functions that don't modify any data members must be declared \c const. In those rare cases where a
semantically \c const member function does update a data member such as a cached value, compiler errors
can be avoided by declaring the data member \c mutable.

\subsection DevCodingLangStat Static variables

Do not use mutable variables with static allocation except for representing truly program-global system resources. Even
then, never declare mutable static variables in a non-local scope, i.e. as static data members of a class or at global
or named namespace scope. Instead, define mutable static variables inside a function, or inside an anonymous namespace
in a .cpp file.

To initialize the static data, either provide a constant initializer (actually, \c constexpr, because then the language
guarantees initialization before program execution starts), or use the \c std::call_once() function to guarantee that
initialization is performed exactly once even when called from multiple threads. If the static data can change after
initialization, properly guard all access with a mutex to ensure thread safety.

In some cases it may be acceptable to require that the user of the class in which the static data occurs explicitly
initializes the data at program startup, before multiple threads are spawned. In this scenario, one can also provide a
finalize function, to be called before program termination, so that all resources are cleaned up. This is unfortunately
not (trivially) possible in the scenario using the \c std::call_once() function.

\subsection DevCodingLangCast Data types and casting

Use \c size_t rather than \c int for indices. Avoid mixing signed and unsigned types in assignments and comparisons.
If you must, use explicit casting (if not, many compilers generate warnings for such mixing).

Avoid casting in general. In any case, never use C-style casts. Instead use the appropriate choice of \c static_cast,
\c const_cast or \c dynamic_cast.

\subsection DevCodingLangPoin Raw and smart pointers

Use the keyword \c nullptr rather than 0 or NULL to represent a null pointer.

Avoid direct use of the \c new and \c delete operators by employing the appropriate standard library facilities.

Rather than C-style arrays, use \c std::array (if the size is known at compile time) or \c std::vector (if the
size can vary at run-time).

Use \c std::unique_ptr to represent exclusive ownership of an object on the heap, and use \c std::make_unique() to
construct a new object and return a \c std::unique_ptr to it in one go. When a \c std::unique_ptr goes out of scope, it
deletes the object being held (if any). Use std::move() to pass ownership around between \c std::make_unique() objects
(for example in a return statement).

Use a raw pointer (or a reference) to represent a reference to an object on the heap without ownership, in cases where
the program logic guarantees that the object will be around at least as long as the raw pointer. Use the member
function get() to get a raw pointer from a \c std::unique_ptr.

Use \c std::shared_ptr to manage shared ownership to an object on the heap, and use \c std::make_shared() to
construct a new object and return a \c std::shared_ptr to it in one go. When the last \c std::shared_ptr referencing a
particular object goes out of scope, it deletes the object being held. \c std::shared_ptr is more expensive than \c
std::unique_ptr because of its reference counting, so use it only when the program logic cannot easily guarantee the
lifetime of the managed object in another way.

Do \em not use \c std::auto_ptr -- it is deprecated and broken.

\subsection DevCodingLangArgs Function arguments and return values

Pass function arguments by constant reference rather than by value, except for variables of primitive types (and
perhaps cheap types such as \c std::string in situations where performance is not of key importance). Avoid "output"
arguments.

Never return a reference or a pointer to a local object.

\subsection DevCodingLangAuto Auto type declarations

For simple types such as \c double, \c int, or \c std::string, it is usually better to use an explicit type name
in the declaration to avoid confusing the reader. However, in many other situations \c auto type declarations
help to reduce typing and make the code more readable.

For example, when constructing a new object on the heap as in the following code, there is no need to repeat the type
of the resulting smart pointer in the variable declaration; it is obvious to both humans and compilers:

\verbatim
auto widget = std::make_unique<Widget>("This is my widget");
widget->doSomething();
\endverbatim

As a second example, consider a container mapping strings to widget pointers, and assume that we occasionally need to
make all widgets in the map do something:

\verbatim
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<Widget>> widgetMap;
...
for (auto& pair : widgetMap)
{
    if (pair.second) pair.second->doSomething();
}
\endverbatim

The iterator over \c widgetMap in the range-based \c for loop returns values of type \c <c>std::pair<const std::string,
std::unique_ptr<Widget>></c>. This complexity is hidden by using \c auto in the loop variable declaration.

Note that the example declares the loop variable as a reference to avoid copying the values being iterated over. In
this case, the code would not compile without the ampersand because a \c std::unique_ptr cannot be copied. For copyable
objects the code would compile but might not achieve the desired effect: the loop body would modify a copy of each
object rather than the objects in the container themselves. As a general rule, use pass by value (\c auto), pass by
mutable reference (\c auto\&), or pass by constant reference (\c const \c auto\&) as you would for function arguments.

As a final example, \c auto can hide the complex type of a standard container iterator:

\verbatim
std::vector<std::string> list;
...
auto it = std::find(list.begin(), list.end(), "string-to-find");
if (it != list.end())
{
    std::string found = *it;
    ...
}
\endverbatim

\subsection DevCodingLangConsDest Constructors, destructors, and assignment operators

In classes that are not intended to be copied or moved (including many classes that manage
resources and most polymorphic classes), declare the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator as \c deleted
(with public access). There is no need to declare the corresponding move operations as \c deleted, because these won't
be implicitly generated as soon as the copy operations are declared.

In classes that need to be copied or moved, and require special treatment to do so (i.e. memberwise copy/move
is insufficient), implement all of the following: copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator,
move assignment operator, and destructor.

A polymorpic class is a class with one or more \c virtual functions. In the base class of a polymorphic class
hierarchy, declare the destructor \c virtual. Never call virtual functions from a constructor or a destructor.

\subsection DevCodingLangInhe Inheritance

Don't use private or protected inheritance; use aggregation instead.

Use multiple inheritance with care. Restrict base classes to a single polymorphic class, zero or more \em mix-in
classes (no virtual functions) and zero or more \em interfaces (only virtual functions without implementations).

When overriding a virtual function, declare it \c override (adding that keyword at the end and dropping the \c virtual
specifier at the beginning). Never redefine an inherited non-virtual function.

Declare data members private and provide public or protected getters and/or setters to access them.

\subsection DevCodingLangExce Exception handling

Strive for exception-safe code. In other words, leak no resources and don't leave data structures
in an invalid state when an exception is thrown.

Throw exceptions by value and catch them by reference.

Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors.

\subsection DevCodingLangCont Containers

Use \c std::string to represent UTF-8 encoded text strings. Avoid C-style strings except for string constants.
Use the string manipulation functions offered by the custom StringUtils class to augment the admittedly weak facilities
provided by the \c std::string class itself.

Use the custom Array class to represent an array of floating point values with predictable size (i.e. the size can
be configured at run time before the array is actually used). Likewise, use the custom Table or ArrayTable templates
to represent multi-dimensional tables of floating point values with predictable size.

In cases where a different data type must be stored, or the array size can't be predicted before use, \c std::vector is
the default choice to represent an array or list of values. If the array size is known at compile time, use \c
std::array instead. As an exception to the above, avoid the use of \c std::vector<bool>.

Use \c std::unordered_set to represent a set of values, and \c std::unordered_map to represent key-value pairs.

When available, prefer container member functions over general algorithms with the same name (because the member
functions are much more efficient). Also, call \c empty() instead of checking \c size() against zero.

Use constant iterators obtained with \c cbegin() and \c cend() where appropriate.

Consider emplacement instead of insertion to avoid extra copying for non-trivial data types. For example, with \c
std::vector this would mean calling \c emplace_back() rather than \c push_back(). With \c std::unordered_map there is
an extra benefit: using \c emplace() avoids the need to explicitely create a \c std::pair holding the key/value pair:

\verbatim
std::unordered_map<std::string,std::string> map;
std::string key = ...
std::string value = ...
map.emplace(key,value);
\endverbatim

\subsection DevCodingLangLamb Lambda expressions

Generic (template) functions often require the user to provide a call-back function specifying some operation or test.
A lambda expression is usually the best way to provide such a call-back function. For example:

\verbatim
std::vector<int> list;
...
auto it = std::find_if(list.cbegin(), list.cend(), [](int k) { return 0<k && k<10; });
\endverbatim

When defining lambda expressions, do not use default capture modes, but explicitly list the captured variables.
Include \c this in the list to capture the data members of the current class instance.

\subsection DevCodingLangAlgo Algorithms

Consider the use of standard library algorithms rather than ad-hoc implementations of these algorithms. Employ lambda
expressions for specifying predicates, comparisons and operations. Once you are familiar with the common algorithms and
the lambda expression syntax, the resulting code is more compact, more readable and less error-prone.
A notable exception is the \c std::for_each() algorithm: a range-based \c for loop is often the better choice.

Obvious examples include \c std::swap() to swap values; \c std::min(), \c std::max(), and \c std::minmax() to find the
lower and upper limits in a list of two or more values; and \c std::sort() and \c std::stable_sort() for sorting a
range of values. Avoid the C-style \c qsort() function.

Other perhaps less obvious candidates include \c std::all_of(), \c std::any_of(), and \c std::none_of() to verify
a condition on a range; \c std::count and \c std::count_if to count the occurrences of a given
value or condition in a range; \c std::accumulate() to add or otherwise combine a range of values; and much more.

The \c std::remove() and \c std::remove_if() algorithms just reorder elements without actually removing them. So follow
the use of these algorithms by a call to the \c erase() member function of the target container if you really want to
remove the elements.
