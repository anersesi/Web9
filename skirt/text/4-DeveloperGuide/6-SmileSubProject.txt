\section DevSmileIntro Introduction

The SMILE subproject implements the mechanisms for handling configuration files in \c SKIRT and \c MakeUp. The code in
this subproject is designed as a generic framework that can be used ouside of the \c SKIRT project as well.

The SMILE acronym stands for "Simple Metadata Interactive Language Editing". SMILE is a metadata language that can
represent configuration files for software programs or other simple datasets; see \ref DevSmileLang below for more
information.

The SMILE project supports the SMILE metadata language. It includes utilities for creating and editing SMILE datasets,
and a C++ library that can be used by software programs outside of the SMILE project called \em clients. The overall
project structure is illustrated in the following diagram. The arrows indicate dependencies. The components inside
the dashed line are part of the SMILE project.

At the center of the project is the SMILE C++ library that offers facilities for working with SMILE schema's and
datasets. The library allows a SMILE client to establish a direct correspondence between the client's C++ classes and
objects and SMILE schema's and datasets on the other hand. Specifically, the discovery services in the SMILE library
translate the SMILE metadata provided for each relevant client C++ class to a SMILE schema. Using this schema, the
resurrection services in the SMILE library can construct a run-time object hierarchy reflecting any SMILE dataset
conforming to the schema. This happens in a fully type-safe manner, using standard C++ functionality.

The SMILE C++ library is organized in three layers with strict unidirectional dependencies:

- The bottom layer offers fundamental functions including platform-independent system interaction, basic string
  handling, and low-level XML processing.
- The middle layer contains the meat of the library, including facilities for processing SMILE schema's and
  representing SMILE datasets in memory, and for performing introspection
  (or \em discovery) on C++ classes in SMILE client code.
- The top layer uses the capabilities of the other layers to serialize and deserialize SMILE data sets, and to
  resurrect a client's C++ object hierarchy from a SMILE dataset.

The <code>smiletool</code> command-line utility offers a text-based question and answer session for creating a SMILE
dataset of any particular type, given a SMILE schema. Just as the SMILE C++ library, this tool is written in standard
C++ so that it is very portable. The \c MakeUp desktop utility offers an even more user-friendly, wizard-style,
graphical user interface for creating and editing SMILE datasets of any particular type, again given the corresponding
SMILE schema. This utility relies on (and thus requires installation of) the open source Qt GUI framework
(https://www.qt.io).

Because all information about the make-up of a SMILE dataset is defined in the corresponding SMILE schema, the
operation of the <code>smiletool</code> and \c MakeUp utilities is fully uncoupled from the operation of any other
SMILE clients. For example, a future Web-browser-based utility might very well offer similar SMILE dataset creation and
editing. While this would require re-implementing part of the SMILE library using Web-based technologies, it would not
affect any of the other components.

\section DevSmileUsage Using the SMILE library

There are two fundamentally distinct ways of using the SMILE C++ library. On the one hand, generic utilities such as
those shown on the right-hand side of the above diagram (including, e.g., <code>smiletool</code>) can work with any type
of SMILE dataset, as long as the corresponding SMILE schema file is available. The items in a SMILE dataset are
represented in memory as so-called \em ghost items that offer generic functionality to store their type and manage
their property values. A ghost item has no built-in knowledge about the properties it should support. It instead counts
on the schema definition to provide this information.

On the other hand, as shown on the left-hand side of the above diagram, a SMILE client (such as the \c shapes example
program) can implicitly define a SMILE schema through metadata embedded in the Item subclasses of the program. In this
case, the client code implements additional functionality that uses the values of the SMILE properties of its classes
in some application-specific way. The SMILE library establishes a direct correspondence between the client's C++
classes and a SMILE schema, and between instances of the client's classes and items in a SMILE dataset. Specifically,
the discovery services in the SMILE library translate the SMILE metadata provided for each relevant client C++ class to
a SMILE schema. Using this schema, the resurrection services in the SMILE library can construct a run-time object
hierarchy reflecting any SMILE dataset conforming to the schema.

The \c SKIRT program, for which the SMILE project was conceived, offers a typical use case. \c SKIRT defines a large
set of C++ classes implementing its simulation capabilities. A particular \c SKIRT simulation can be configured by
constructing an aggregation of instances of these classes at run time, and setting their property values. The
simulation is then executed by the code in the various classes, fully depending on the configured run-time structure
and property values. \c SKIRT uses the SMILE library to save a SMILE schema reflecting its simulation class hierarchy.
This schema can then be loaded into one of the independent, generic SMILE utilities for creating or editing a SMILE
data set acting as a configuration file for \c SKIRT. Subsequently, \c SKIRT uses the SMILE library to construct a
run-time object hierarchy (instantiating the \c SKIRT client classes) mirroring the configuration file, and which is
used to perform the requested simulation. As an alternative for the user who doesn't have access to the seperate SMILE
dataset editing utilities, \c SKIRT uses the SMILE library to implement a built-in console query and answer session.

Another use case is a program that requires a simple settings file, without a tight coupling between the structure of
the settings file and the internal class hierarchy. In this case, the program developer "manually" creates a SMILE
schema for the dataset (a SMILE schema for SMILE schema's is provided with the SMILE project for this purpose). A user
can then create or edit a settings file using one of the generic SMILE utilities. The program can use the facilities of
the SMILE library to load the settings file and access its contents from the ghost items representing the SMILE dataset
in memory.

\section DevSmileLang The SMILE metadata language

\subsection DevSmileLangOver Overview

SMILE is a metadata language that can represent simple datasets such as property lists or configuration files for
software programs. A SMILE dataset can be stored as a text file using a subset of the standard XML format, which makes
it easy to create, modify and use electronically. In addition, the SMILE XML format is fairly accessable for direct
viewing and editing by a moderately advanced user.

While SMILE uses a limited subset of the XML standard, it supports complicated data structures including:
 - Scalar properties of type string, Boolean, enumeration, integer number, and floating point number.
 - Compound properties aggregating any combination of scalar and/or compound properties, up to any nesting level.
 - Variable-length lists of properties of the same type (scalar or compound).
 - Arbitrary schema-defined units for floating point numbers that represent physical quantities.

\subsection DevSmileLangSchema SMILE schema's

The data structure of a particular type of SMILE files is defined by a SMILE schema, which is in turn a SMILE file
(with its own schema - a nice recursion!). This allows software tools to validate the proper construction of a SMILE
file. Equally important, a software tool can guide a user to create or edit a SMILE file that conforms to a given SMILE
schema, without any information other than the schema.

The following diagram shows the structure of a SMILE schema.
A connection starting with a diamond represents aggregation, i.e. it means "A uses one or more B's".
A connection starting with a triangle represents inheritance, i.e. it means "A is a base for B".

\note If the value of the \em quantity attribute for floating point properties starts with an at sign, the quantity is
determined instead as the string value of the indicated enumeration property. In that case, because the string value of
an enumeration property can't be empty, a value representing an unknown quantity is silently replaced by the empty
string to represent a dimensionless quantity.

\note If there are two or more unit systems, there must also be types with the same names as the unit systems and these
types must have an unambiguous common base type. Furthermore, an item property with this base type must be included
somewhere close to the top of the hierarchy. The actual subtype selected for this property in the dataset will then
determine the default unit system for the dataset.

\subsection DevSmileLangCond SMILE conditional expressions

<b>Objectives</b>

The SMILE schema language supports dynamically adjusting default values and displaying or hiding options based on
choices made earlier in the configuration process. These earlier choices may represent various aspects of the
configuration; for example, in case of the \c SKIRT client:

 - The level of expertise selected by the user (e.g. basic, regular, advanced).
 - The overall simulation mode configured (e.g. including secondary emission or not).
 - The level of spatial symmetry in the input model (i.e. 1D, 2D or 3D).

All the metadata needed to control these capabilities is defined in the SMILE schema, and thus in case of a
client such as \c SKIRT, in the SMILE metadata declared with each class.

<b>Names and namespaces</b>

In this discussion, we assume that the engine driving the SMILE configuration user interface scans the type and
property hierarchy of the SMILE schema in a sequential manner, allowing only forward navigation. If the engine allows
the user to navigate backwards (or even randomly), it must emulate the sequential behavior for the purposes of the
capabilities discussed here.

The engine maintains two sets of names with a different scope. The global set contains names that stay around for the
duration of the configuration session. The local set contains names that stay around only while configuring the
properties of a particular type; a fresh local set is created for each type instance. By definition, the global set
contains names that start with an uppercase letter, and the local set contains names that start with a lowercase
letter. As a result, the two sets form disjoint namespaces. After the first character (which must be a letter), a name
can include any mix of letters and digits (and no other characters). Names are never removed from a set (although the
local set is regularly discarded and replaced by a new one as a whole). Names are inserted in each of the sets as
follows:

 - Upon creation of the global set, the engine inserts the name “True”.
 - Upon creation of a local set, the engine inserts the name “true”.
 - Whenever a particular type is added to the configuration (because the user selects the type as the value of a
   compound property), the engine inserts the name of the type and the names of its ancestor types, recursively,
   into the global set. This requires all type names to start with an uppercase letter.
 - Whenever a particular property is given a value in the configuration (which implies that the property is relevant),
   the engine may insert the name of the property or a name starting with the property name into the local set,
   according to the property-type-dependent rules summarized in the following table. This requires all property names
   to start with a lowercase letter.

| Property type | Insert what | If and only if
|---------------|-------------|---------------
| Int | property name | numeric value is nonzero
| Double | property name | numeric value is nonzero
| Bool | property name | Boolean value is true
| String | property name | string contents is not empty
| Item | property name | item is present (i.e. not null)
| DoubleList | property name | double list is not empty
| ItemList | property name | item list is not empty
| Enum | Property name + enumeration value | always

In addition, the "insert" type or property attribute may cause one or more names given in the attribute value to be
inserted whenever the value of the corresponding property or type is being configured. In that case, each name
is inserted in the global or local set depending on the capitalization of the first letter in the name.

\note The following names are reserved; any attempt to insert them through schema attributes will cause a fatal error:
True, False, true, false.

<b>Boolean expressions</b>

Some type or property attributes accept an arbitrary Boolean expression that will be evaluated to true or false
whenever the value is required. The expression is formed by combining identifiers (consisting of letters and digits) in
the usual way with the unary negation operator #!, the binary OR operator #|, the binary AND operator #&, and
(balanced) parenthesis. In the absence of parenthesis, the negation operator has the highest precedence; otherwise
operations are executed from left to right.

When evaluating the expression, identifiers that correspond to a name currently in the global or local set are replaced
by the Boolean value \em true; other identifiers are replaced by \em false.

<b>Conditional value expressions</b>

Some type or property attributes accept a conditional value expression that will be evaluated to one of the specified
values whenever the value is required. The syntax of a conditional value expression can be illustrated as follows:

    <Boolean-expression1>:<value1>; ... ;[<Boolean-expressionN>:]<valueN>

In other words, there is a sequence of one or more condition-value pairs separated by a semicolon, while the condition
and the value are separated by a colon. In the last pair of the sequence, the condition (including the colon) may be
missing; if so it defaults to “true”.

Note that this syntax precludes the values to contain colons and semicolons. This is no problem for numerical values or
for type names, and even for string values it will most likely not be a significant limitation.

The pairs in the conditional value expression are considered from left to right. When the condition for a pair
evaluates to true (using the Boolean expression rules explained above), the corresponding value represents the value of
the complete expression and further evaluation is terminated.

<b>Attributes</b>

The following table lists the type and property attributes that support conditional values:

| Attribute | Value type | Default | Available for
|-----------|------------|---------|--------------
| allowedIf | Boolean expression | true | type
| relevantIf | Boolean expression | true | property
| displayedIf | Boolean expression | true | type, property
| requiredIf | Boolean expression | true | property
| default | conditional value expression | - | property
| insert | conditional value expression | - | type, property

A type is listed as part of the choices for an item property if both its \em allowedIf and \em displayedIf attributes
evaluate to true. The difference between these attributes for a type lie only in the reason for the omission of the
type: in the first case, including the type would create an invalid configuration, in the second case, the user does
not have the expertise to deal with the type.

A property is displayed as part of the configuration for a given type instance if both its \em relevantIf and \em
displayedIf attributes evaluate to true. The difference between these attributes for a property is similar to that for
types: in the first case, the value of the property will not be used in the current configuration, in the second case,
the user does not have the expertise to deal with the property. This semantic difference has some intricate
consequences. For example, the engine must be able to derive a meaningful value for a relevant property, even if it is
not displayed. Thus, such a property must either be optional (i.e., not required) or have a default value.

Supporting a conditional value expression for the \em default attribute enables providing a different default value
depending on the configuration so far.

The value of the conditional value expression in the \em insert attribute can be a single name or a list of names
separated by commas. The names are inserted in the global or local set depending on their first letter, as described
before. The insert attribute facilitates managing complex dependencies in the configuration.


\section DevSmileComp SMILE project components

\subsection DevSmileCompTool The smiletool command-line utility

The <code>smiletool</code> command-line utility offers a text-based question and answer session for creating a SMILE
dataset of a particular type, according to one of the SMILE schema files residing in a schema library directory.
Such a session can be started as follows:

\verbatim
smiletool  -l <library_dirpath>
\endverbatim

The tool can also be used to create a LaTeX representation of a SMILE dataset, as long as the corresponding SMILE
schema is in the library. For example:

\verbatim
smiletool  -l <library_dirpath> -i <input_dataset_filepath> -t <output_latex_filepath>
\endverbatim

In more detail, the <code>smiletool</code> command-line tool supports the following command line arguments; they are all
optional and their order is not significant:

\verbatim
smiletool [-i <input_dataset_filepath>]
          [-o <output_dataset_filepath>] [-t <output_latex_filepath>]
          [-l <library_dirpath>] [-s <schema_filename>]
\endverbatim

If an input dataset filepath is present (the -i option), the specified dataset is loaded into memory. Otherwise, an
interactive console query and answer session is conducted to create a new dataset in memory.

If an output dataset filepath is present (the -o option), the memory dataset is saved to the specified file. Similarly,
if an output latex filepath is present (the -t option), the memory dataset is converted to LaTeX source form and saved
to the specified file. In both cases, an appropriate filename extension is added if needed, and an existing file with
the final name gets overwritten without warning. The -o and -t options can both be specified at the same time. If
neither is specified, the user is prompted for a dataset filename at the console. In this case, an appropriate filename
extension is added if needed as well, however the name of an existing file will not be accepted.

To operate the tool in batch, i.e. without console prompting, both an input dataset filepath (the -i option) and at
least one output filepath (-o and/or -t options) must be present.

The library directory path (the -l option) specifies the location of SMILE schema files. If this option is missing, the
current directory is used instead. The schema file name (the -s option) specifies the schema to be used for
interpreting or constructing a dataset. The .schema filename extension is added if needed. The schema file must reside
in the library directory. If this option is missing, the appropriate schema is either derived from the input data set
(if one is specified), or the user is asked to select a schema from those found in the library directory.

\subsection DevSmileCompMakeUp The MakeUp desktop utility

The \c MakeUp desktop utility offers a user-friendly, wizard-style, graphical user interface for creating and editing
SMILE datasets of any particular type, given the corresponding SMILE schema. This utility relies on (and thus requires
installation of) the open source Qt GUI framework (https://www.qt.io).

On some systems, \c MakeUp can be launched by double-clicking its application icon. For example, on Mac OS X, \c MakeUp
is built as an application bundle. However, it can always be launched via the command-line. For example, on Mac OS X:

\verbatim
.../MakeUp.app/Contents/MacOS/MakeUp
\endverbatim

When launched for the first time, \c MakeUp searches for a default SMILE schema library in its immediate vicinity
in the file system. However, in any case, the path to the SMILE schema library can be selected
through the graphical interface on the initial panel of the wizard:

\image html DevSmileMakeUpBasicChoice.png

For each SMILE schema found in the library directory, the initial panel shows two options: one to create and configure
a new dataset, and one to open and edit an existing dataset. The user can navigate through the wizard panes by
selecting the appropriate choices (or filling in fields) and clicking the "Continue" and "Back" buttons at the bottom.
Here is an example wizard pane shown as part of the editing process of a shapes parameter file:

\image html DevSmileMakeUpShapeSample.png

In essence, \c MakeUp asks the same questions as the <code>smiletool</code> command-line tool using a nicer interface.
There are two important additional benefits though:
 - \c MakeUp allows navigating back to and updating the answers provided for previous questions.
 - \c MakeUp allows opening and updating an existing dataset.

\subsection DevSmileCompFund The fundamentals layer

The fundamentals layer offers low-level capabilities including platform-independent system interaction, basic
string handling, and XML processing. The following paragraphs introduce a few selected classes in this layer.

The Basics header file should be included directly or indirectly in all program units for the project to include the
headers for some frequently-used standard library facilities in a consistent manner.

The System class provides a set of functions that interact with the operating system or with the file system, often in
a platform-dependent manner. One important function of the class is translating internal UTF-8 encoded strings to and
from the encoding expected by the host system. A single instance of the System class must be constructed just after
program startup.

The Array, Table and ArrayTable classes implement containers that hold sequences of double values with a predictable
size (i.e. the array or table size is known at run time when the container is first initialized). The Array class
allows easily and efficiently performing mathematical operations on the corresponding values in multiple arrays. The
Table and ArrayTable classes offer multi-dimensional table indexing.

The StringUtils class offers facilities for working with std::string objects, including various query and transform
functions and conversions to and from numeric data types.

The CommandLineArguments class serves as a basic command line parser. It supports any number of filepath arguments and
options with or without a value. Individual filepaths, options, and option values must be separated from each other by
whitespace. An option always starts with a dash; a filepath and an option value don't.

The XmlReader and XmlWriter classes implement reading and writing of the XML subset that is sufficient to represent
SMILE schemas and datasets. The classes support well-formed XML 1.0 documents with certain additional limitations and
caveats, as decribed in the respective class headers.

\subsection DevSmileCompSchema The schema and discovery layer

The schema and discovery layer offers facilities for processing SMILE schema's and representing SMILE datasets in
memory, and for performing introspection (or \em discovery) on C++ classes in SMILE client code.

The Item class is the abstract base class for classes corresponding to the SMILE data types listed in a SMILE schema.
In other words, an instance of an Item subclass represents a particular \em item in a dataset described by a SMILE
schema. \em Ghost items are instances of the GhostItem class (based on Item) defined as part of the SMILE library. A
ghost item offers generic functionality to store its type and to manage property values. \em Client items are instances
of Item subclasses defined in client code that uses the SMILE library. These classes define SMILE properties through
the macros provided for that purpose in the ItemInfo.hpp header file, and implement additional functionality that uses
the values of these properties in some application-specific way. The Item base class offers facilities to help manage a
run-time item hierarchy (reflecting the structure of a given SMILE dataset), and to support the discovery mechanisms
offered by other parts of the SMILE library.

The ItemRegistry class manages the global registry of client Item subclasses defined in a program. Client Item
subclasses must be explicitly registered with the registry at startup.

The SchemaDef class represents a SMILE schema definition. It offers facilities for loading a SMILE schema from file or,
through the ItemRegistry, from the discovery metadata published by a set of client Item subclasses. Portions of the
schema definition are represented by instances of the TypeDef, PropertyDef, and UnitDef classes. A SchemaDef instance
can construct SMILE items (i.e. instances of Item subclasses) given their type (as a string), and can spawn an
appropriate property handler (see below) given a target item and a property name (as a string).

The PropertyHandler class and its subclasses handle SMILE data item properties for the purpose of serialization and
resurrection. A PropertyHandler subclass instance combines knowledge about the schema definition describing the SMILE
dataset being handled, the target data item within that dataset, the target property within that item, and the type of
that property. There is a specific PropertyHandler subclass for each supported property type, including string,
Boolean, enumeration, integer, floating point and pointer to item types. These latter property types are used to link
items into a hierarchy that reflects a given SMILE dataset.

\subsection DevSmileCompSerial The serialization and resurrection layer

The serialization and resurrection layer uses the capabilities of the other layers to serialize and deserialize SMILE
data sets, and to resurrect a client's C++ object hierarchy from a SMILE dataset.

For example, the XmlHierarchyCreator class offers a static function to create a memory representation of a SMILE
dataset, given its XML serialization (in a file) and the corresponding schema definition (as a SchemaDef instance). If
the schema definition was derived from the metadata published by a set of client Item subclasses in the program, the
items in the returned hierarchy will be instances of the appropriate client Item subclasses. If the schema definition
was loaded from an XML file, the items in the returned hierarchy will be GhostItem instances.

Conversely, the XmlHierarchyWriter class offers a static function to write the structure and properties of a SMILE
dataset representation in memory to an XML file, given the corresponding schema definition (as a SchemaDef instance).
The function works for both client and ghost item hierarchies. The generated XML file contains sufficient information
to reconstruct a fresh copy of the SMILE dataset (using the XmlHierarchyCreator class).

The other classes in this layer provide similar services. The ConsoleHierarchyCreator class implements a console query
and answer session to construct a (client or ghost) memory representation of a SMILE dataset. The LatexHierarchyWriter
class outputs a LaTeX representation of a SMILE dataset that can be easily turned into a nicely formatted document
using a LaTeX processor.

\subsection DevSmileCompShapes The shapes example program

The shapes command-line program included in the SMILE project serves as an example of the typical SMILE library use
case. The program defines a small set of client Item subclasses for representing a collection of two-dimensional shapes
and their properties (see ShapeItem and its subclasses). Given an interconnected run-time tree of instances of these
classes, the program can render a visualization of the described collection to a pixel image (see the Canvas class).
The program uses the ItemInfo.hpp macros to declare discovery metadata for the ShapeItem subclasses and their
properties (see, e.g., the ColorDecorator class), and registers these classes with the SMILE item registry (see the
ShapeRegistry class). The SMILE schema definition derived from this information describes a SMILE dataset that, in
turn, represents a collection of shapes that can be rendered by the program.

The shapes program supports the following command line arguments (see the ShapesCommandLineHandler class):

\verbatim
shapes -x <library_dirpath>
shapes <shapes_dataset_filepath> [-o <tiff_output_filepath>]
\endverbatim

The first form causes a SMILE schema file to be generated corresponding to the metadata in the source code (i.e. in the
class definitions of the Item subclasses). The file is named 'shapes.smile' and is placed in the specified directory.
Assuming that this file is placed in the appropriate schema library directory, the <code>smiletool</code> command-line
tool and/or the \c MakeUp desktop utility are now enabled to create and edit shapes parameter files (as shown in the
section on \ref DevSmileCompMakeUp).

The second form generates a TIFF image based on the instructions provided in the shapes parameter file (a SMILE
dataset) specified as the first command line argument. The \c .shapes filename extension may be included or omitted. If
the optional output filepath is present (the -o option), it specifies the path to the image file that will be created
according to the instructions in the parameter file. The \c .tiff filename extension is added unless the filepath
already has the \c .tiff filename extension. If the -o option is not present, the output filepath is derived from the
parameter filepath by replacing the \c .smile filename extension by the .tiff filename extension.

Below is an example shapes parameter file. Because the design goal was to show
various SMILE features, the structure of the parameter file is perhaps more complicated than it could have been.

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<shapes-definition type="ShapeCanvas" format=".." producer=".." time="..">
    <ShapeCanvas>
        <shape type="Shape">
            <ShapeGroup>
                <shapes type="Shape">
                    <RectangleShape x="0.6 m" y="0.2 m" width="0.5 m" height="0.1 m"/>
                    <ColorDecorator color="Red">

                        </shape>
                    </ColorDecorator>
                    <WidthDecorator width="0.03">
                        <shape type="Shape">
                            <ColorDecorator color="Custom" rgb="0.4, 0.1, 0.9">
                                <shape type="Shape">
                                    <RectangleShape x="0.3 m" y="0.4 m" width="0.3 m" height="0.1 m"/>
                                </shape>
                            </ColorDecorator>
                        </shape>
                    </WidthDecorator>
                    <PolygonShape x="0.25 m" y="0.75 m" radius="0.2 m" numSides="5" align="true"/>
                </shapes>
            </ShapeGroup>
        </shape>
    </ShapeCanvas>
</shapes-definition>
\endverbatim
