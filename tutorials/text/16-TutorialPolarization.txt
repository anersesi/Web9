\page TutorialPolarization Dust scattering polarization signatures of spiral galaxies

In this tutorial you will work with a basic spiral galaxy model that includes the effects of polarization caused by the
scattering of stellar radiation by spherical dust grains. You will discover a signature of the spiral arms in the
polarization degree of the observed radiation, at least for this simplified model.

\section TutorialPolarizationPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory \c SKIRT tutorials \ref TutorialBasicsMono ad \ref
TutorialBasicsPan, or that you have otherwise acquired the working knowlegde introduced there. Also, before starting
this tutorial, you should have installed the \c SKIRT code, and preferably a FITS file viewer such as DS9 and the
Python toolkit for \c SKIRT (\c PTS).

To avoid spending time creating yet another \c SKIRT configuration file from scratch, the \c SKIRT web site offers a
fully configured \em ski file for download that will serve as a basis for this tutorial. Download the file \c
tutorial_polarization_config.xml from the <a href="../version9/_downloads.html">SKIRT downloads page</a> and put it
into your local working directory.


\section TutorialPolarizationIntro Polarization background

\subsection TutorialPolarizationIntroStokes Stokes vector

The polarization state of electromagnetic radiation is commonly described by the Stokes vector, \f$\boldsymbol{S}\f$,

\f[
\boldsymbol{S} = \begin{pmatrix} I \\ Q \\ U \\ V \end{pmatrix},
\f]

where \f$I\f$ represents the intensity of the radiation, \f$Q\f$ and \f$U\f$ describe linear polarization, and \f$V\f$
describes circular polarization. The degree of linear polarization,\f$P_{\text{L}}\f$, can be
written as a function of the Stokes parameters,

\f[
P_{\text{L}} = \frac{\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}}{I}.
\f]

The (linear) polarization angle, \f$\gamma\f$, can be written as

\f[
\gamma = \frac12\arctan_2\left(\frac{U}{Q}\right),
\f]

where \f$\arctan_2\f$ denotes the inverse tangent function that preserves the quadrant. Combining these equations,
we can also write

\f[
Q = I P_{\text{L}} \cos2\gamma,\\
U = I P_{\text{L}} \sin2\gamma.
\f]

The values of \f$Q\f$ and \f$U\f$ depend on the polarization angle \f$\gamma\f$, which describes the angle between the
direction of linear polarization and a given reference direction in the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction.
The angle is measured counter-clockwise when looking at the source. The reference direction can be chosen arbitrarily
as long as it is well defined and perpendicular to the propagation direction. However, when the polarization state
changes as a result of an interaction (e.g., a scattering event), most recipes for properly adjusting the Stokes vector
require the reference direction to have a specific orientation (e.g., lying in the scattering plane). Before applying
the recipe, the existing reference direction must be rotated about the propagation direction to match this requirement.
This is accomplished by multiplying the Stokes vector by a rotation matrix, \f${\bf{R}}(\varphi)\f$,

\f[
\boldsymbol{S}_\text{new} = {\bf{R}}(\varphi)\,\boldsymbol{S}.
\f]

A rotation about the direction of propagation by an angle \f$\varphi\f$, counter-clockwise when looking toward the
source of the beam, is described by the matrix

\f[
{\bf{R}}(\varphi)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos2\varphi & \sin2\varphi & 0 \\
0 & -\sin2\varphi & \cos2\varphi & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]

To record the polarization state change for a scattering event, the Stokes vector is multiplied by the Müller matrix,
\f${\bf{M}}\f$, corresponding to the event, assuming that the reference direction lies in the scattering plane (as well
as in the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction). The Müller matrix components depend on the geometry of the
scattering event and the physical properties of the scatterer, and they often depend on the wavelength. In general, the
Müller matrix is

\f[
{\bf{M}(\theta,\lambda)}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} & S_{14} \\
S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} & S_{24} \\
S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33} & S_{34} \\
S_{41} & S_{42} & S_{43} & S_{44}
\end{pmatrix},
\f]

where \f$\theta\f$ is the angle between the propagation directions before and after the scattering event, and \f$\lambda\f$ is
the wavelength of the radiation. For clarity of presentation, we drop the dependencies from the notation for the
individual Müller matrix components. Including the reference direction adjustments before and after the actual
scattering event, \f$\varphi\f$ and \f$\varphi_\text{new}\f$, the transformation of a Stokes vector for a scattering event can
thus be written as

\f[
\boldsymbol{S}_\text{new} = \bf{R}(\varphi_\text{new})\,\bf{M}(\theta,\lambda)\,\bf{R}(\varphi)\,\boldsymbol{S}.
\f]

For scattering by spherical particles, the Müller matrix simplifies to
\f[
{\bf{M_\mathrm{Sph}}}(\theta,\lambda)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
S_{11} & S_{12} & 0 & 0 \\
S_{12} & S_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & S_{33} & S_{34} \\
0 & 0 & -S_{34} & S_{33}
\end{pmatrix},
\f]
again assuming that the reference direction lies in the scattering plane.
The Müller matrices for a particular grain size and material can be calculated using Mie theory.

For scattering by electrons, also called Thomson scattering, the Müller matrix is wavelength-independent and can be
expressed analytically as a function of the scattering angle,

\f[
{\bf{M_\mathrm{Th}}}(\theta)
=\frac12
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos^2\theta +1 & \cos^2\theta -1 & 0 & 0 \\
\cos^2\theta -1 & \cos^2\theta +1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2\cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 &  2\cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]

\subsection TutorialPolarizationIntroConventions Conventions

\c SKIRT defines the Stokes vector as presented in the previous subsection, following the recommendations of the
International Astronomical Union. Historically, however, authors have used various conventions for the signs of the
Stokes parameters \f$U\f$ and \f$V\f$. For example, the polarization angle \f$\gamma\f$ is sometimes measured while
looking toward the observer rather than toward the source, flipping the sign of both $U$ and $V$. Reversing the
definition of circular polarization handedness also flips the sign of $V$. Assuming that the adopted conventions are
properly documented, translating the values of the Stokes parameters from one convention into another can be
accomplished by flipping the signs appropriately.


\section TutorialPolarizationSpiral Configuring a spiral galaxy with support for polarization

\subsection TutorialPolarizationSpiralBase The basic configuration

Rather than spending time creating yet another \c SKIRT configuration file from scratch, you can start from a
preconfigured \em ski file offered for download on the \c SKIRT web site (see \ref TutorialPolarizationPre).
As a second step you will then enable polarization in this configuration.

Rename the downloaded file from \c tutorial_polarization_config.xml to a (shorter) name of your liking ending with
the ".ski" filename extension, for example \c Spiral.ski. Run this \em ski file with \c SKIRT. While it is running,
open the ski file in a text editor and examine its contents. You should recognize the
following configuration elements (not in this order):

 - an oligochromatic simulation with three wavelengths, using a few million photon packets in total
 - a spatial geometry with four components:
     - a flattened Sérsic bulge consisting of evolved stars (3500 K)
     - a thicker exponential disk consisting of evolved stars (3500 K), with spiral arm structure
     - a thinner exponential disk consisting of young stars (10000 K), with spiral arm structure
     - an exponential dust disk with spiral arm structure (the arms in the young stellar disk and the dust disk trail
       those in the evolved stellar population by varying the phase zero-points)
 - a material mix called \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, representimg the dust properties used in the Gordon et. al 2017
   \c TRUST benchmark (see <a href="../version9/_benchmarks.html">SKIRT benchmarks</a>)
 - an adaptive octree grid
 - six instruments at various inclination and azimuth angles

After the \c SKIRT simulation completes, examine its output. View the surface brightness frames generated by the
instruments at various inclinations and wavelengths until you are satisfied that the results are as expected.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationSpiralEnab Enabling polarization

Enabling polarization in this configuration is straightforward. Duplicate the \em ski file and rename the copy,
for example to \c SpiralPolar.ski. Open the new file in your text editor and make the following adjustments:
 - on the line listing the material mix used in the configuration, i.e. \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, change the value
   of the \c scatteringType option from "HenyeyGreenstein" to "SphericalPolarization";
 - for each of the six instruments, change the value of the \c recordPolarization option from "false" to "true".

Save these changes and run the updated \em ski file with \c SKIRT. Continue reading while the simulation is running.

As indicated in the introduction, \c SKIRT supports polarization of radiation by scattering of spherical dust grains.
This feature is automatically enabled if the material mixture(s) in the configuration offer the appropriate optical
properties (i.e., essentially, the Müller matrix). In that case, the radiation's polarization properties are tracked as
photon packets move through the medium, and the instruments can be requested to record the components of the Stokes
vector for detected photon packets (accumulated in each pixel/wavelength bin).

The \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix class implements the relevant properties for a "representative grain" of the complete
grain population, i.e. integrated over the size distribution and summed over material types. This is fine for a
treatment of scattering in the optical range (as in this tutorial), but when including dust emission the calculation
requires specific information for multiple grain size bins. This is especially true for small grains that are not in
local thermal equilibrium.

For this purpose, \c SKIRT includes the \c PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition and \c PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition
classes that provide optical properties (including the Müller matrix) for graphite and silicate grains as a function of
grain size. These classes can be configured through the \c ConfigurableDustMix class, but this is outside the scope of
this tutorial.

Finally, \c SKIRT also includes the class \c ElectronMix, which implements wavelength-independent Thomson scattering
for electrons, with optional support for polarization.


\section TutorialPolarizationVisual Visualizing the results

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualFITS Using a FITS viewer

After the \c SKIRT simulation with polarization support completes, examine the output directory. For each instrument,
there now are three extra FITS files containing the Stokes Q, U, and V components, in addition to the "totals" file
containing the intensity (i.e. the Stokes I component).

Open the Q and U components for an instrument with face-on inclination in a FITS file viewer, and open an inspector
showing a histogram of the pixel values (DS9->Scale->Parameters). In contrast to the intensity, the other Stokes
components can have negative values. To enhance visualization of the spatial structure, you may need to play with the
color bar scheme, scale and range. It might help to clip the values at zero (i.e. only showing positive values) to
avoid problems with typical color scales such as the log scale.

Compare the 2D structure of the Q and U components. Examine the differences as you browse through the wavelengths.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualMaps Polarization maps with PTS

While the Stokes components correspond to the output of an actual observation, it is much easier to interprete
quantities such as the polarization degree and angle, which can be calculated from the Stokes vector components as
presented in the section \ref TutorialPolarizationIntroStokes.

If you have the Python Toolkit for \c SKIRT (\c PTS) installed, you can easily generate plots of polarization degree
and angle for the output of a \c SKIRT simulation. To generate a default polarization map per instrument and per
wavelength, simply enter (with the SKIRT output directory as the current directory):

\verbatim
pts plot_polarization . --bin=20
\endverbatim

The \c bin argument specifies the number of image frame pixels (in each spatial direction) to be combined in a single
"polarization" bin. Because of the limited number of photon packets launched for this tutorial, the output is fairly
noisy, and it is best to specify fairly large bins (e.g. 20 by 20 pixels). If you rerun the simulation with
substantially more photon packets, you might get acceptable plots with a reduced bin size.

This produces plots like these:

\image html TutorialPolarizationMapFace.png
\image html TutorialPolarizationMapEdge.png

These figures show surface brightness maps (color scale) overlaid with linear polarization maps (line segments) for the
spiral galaxy model of this tutorial, observed at a wavelength of \f$1 \mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The orientation of the line
segments indicates the polarization angle, and the size of the line segments indicates the degree of linear
polarization. The top figure shows the model face-on, and the bottom figure shows the model edge-on.

The polarization degree is up to 1\% around the central part of the model. In the face-on view, the orientation of the
polarization is circular around the central bulge, showing a clear spiral structure. In the edge-on view, the
polarization degree shows maxima at two positions to the left and two positions to the right of the center. When
comparing with the face-on view, it appears that these positions correspond to the edge-on projection of the spiral arm
structure.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualCurves Average polarization degree plots with PTS

The \c pts \c plot_polarization command can also generate other types of plots. For example, to plot the linear
polarization degree averaged over the Y-axis per instrument and per wavelength, enter:

\verbatim
pts9 plot_polarization . --plot=degavg
\endverbatim

The result is obtained by averaging each individual component of the Stokes vector over the Y-axis at each X position,
and calculating the polarization degree from these totals. This produces plots like this one:

\image html TutorialPolarizationCurve.png

This average polarization degree plot corresponds to the edge-on polarization map shown above (i.e. they are for the
same inclination and wavelength). Even if the two plots unfortunately do not have the same horizontal size, it is
easily verified that the polarization degree maxima indeed occur at the same X-axis positions.

The model confguration for this tutorial includes a second set of instruments with lines of sight at the same
inclinations but with a different azimuthal angle, resulting in a "rotated" view. The figure below shows adjacent
results for the original view (left column) and for the rotated view (right column). This figure was generated through
a custom Python script and is based on a simulation using many more photon packets (see Peest et al. 2017).

\image html TutorialPolarizationGrid.png

From this figure it is clear that regions with higher linear polarization trace the spiral arms at all inclinations,
including the edge-on view. The maxima in the polarization signature of the edge-on view match the positions of the
spiral arms along the line of sight. Indeed, the peaks in the polarization signature align with the tangent points of
the spiral arms, which for the rotated view (right column) are farther out from the center of the galaxy.

These results imply that polarization measurements could be used, at least in principle, to study the spiral structure
of edge-on spiral galaxies, where intensity measurements alone have limited diagnostic power.
