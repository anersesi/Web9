\page TutorialGridsTreeVoro Building a proper SKIRT spatial grid for a spiral galaxy

\c SKIRT employs a spatial grid to discretize the transfer medium of the model. Properties such as the material density
and the calculated radiation field are considered to be constant within each cell of the dust grid. In this tutorial
you will experiment with adaptive grids for a spiral galaxy model in \c SKIRT, and learn how to balance several
conflicting requirements to obtain an 'optimal' grid for your purposes.

\section TutorialGridsTreeVoroPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory \c SKIRT tutorial titled \ref TutorialBasicsMono, or
that you have otherwise acquired the working knowlegde introduced there. At the very least, before starting this
tutorial, you should have installed the \c SKIRT code and a FITS file viewer such as DS9, and preferably the Python
toolkit for \c SKIRT (\c PTS).

Also, before starting this tutorial, <b>please read the concept note</b> on <a
href="../skirt9/_spatial_grids.html">Spatial grids</a> in \c SKIRT. Skipping this step may make it hard to follow along
with the tutorial.


\section TutorialGridsSpiral Configuring a spiral galaxy

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralStart Starting the SKIRT Q&A

As a first step, you need to configure a spiral galaxy model that you can then use to study the adaptive grids offered
by \c SKIRT. In a Terminal window, with an appropriate current directory, start \c SKIRT without any command line
arguments. SKIRT responds with a welcome message and starts an interactive session in the terminal window, during which
it will prompt you for all the information describing a particular simulation:

\verbatim
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Running on ___ for ___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: ArmedSpiralTree
\endverbatim

The first question is for the filename of the \em ski file. For this tutorial, enter "ArmedSpiralTree".

In this and subsequent tutorials, we skip the questions for which there is only one possible answer. The answers to
these questions are provided without prompting the user, and listing them here would bring no added value.

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralLev Experience level

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the user experience level:
      1. Basic: for beginning users (hides many options)
      2. Regular: for regular users (hides esoteric options)
      3. Expert: for expert users (hides no options)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (2): 1
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoLev), the Q&A session can be tailored to the
experience level of the user. For this tutorial, select the \em Basic level.

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralUni Units

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the units system:
      1. SI units
      2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
      3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3):
   Possible choices for the output style for flux density and surface brightness:
      1. Neutral: λ F_λ = ν F_ν
      2. Wavelength: F_λ
      3. Frequency: F_ν
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3):
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoUni), \c SKIRT offers several output unit systems. For
the current tutorial, you will be modelling a galaxy, so select extragalactic units with the frequency output style
(the default options).

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralSim Simulation mode

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the overall simulation mode:
      1. No medium - oligochromatic regime (a few discrete wavelengths)
      2. Extinction only - oligochromatic regime (a few discrete wavelengths)
      ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,6] (4): 2
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoSim), the answer to this question determines the
wavelength regime of the simulation (oligochromatic or panchromatic) and sets the overall scheme for handling media in
the simulation.

In an actual research setting you would probably run a panchromatic simulation to study the absorption, scattering and
thermal emission by the dust over a range of wavelengths. For the purpose of studying the spatial grid in this
tutorial, it is best to limit the simulation run-time by using an oligochromatic simulation at a single optical
wavelength.

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralPho Photon packets

\verbatim
 ? Enter the default number of photon packets launched per simulation segment [0,1e19] (1e6):
\endverbatim

To limit the run time for this tutorial, leave the number of photon packets at the default value of \f$10^6\f$. This
number is sufficient to produce an acceptable image for the simple galaxy model used here.

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralSrc Source system

\verbatim
 ? Enter the wavelengths of photon packets launched from primary sources [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron] (0.55 micron): 0.55

For this tutorial enter a wavelength 'list' consisting of a single value at the center of the V-band,
\f$\lambda=0.55\,\mu\textrm{m}\f$.

\verbatim

   Possible choices for the axisymmetric geometry to be decorated with spiral structure:

 ? Enter the weight of the spiral perturbation ]0,1]: 0.5
\endverbatim

\c SKIRT offers a set of geometry "decorators" that can be used to modify other geometries in various ways. The list
includes straightforward linear transformations such as translation, rotation and flattening; clipping by a sphere,
cylinder or cuboid; and more complex modifications such as adding spiral arm structure or clumpiness. Decorators can be
nested to arbitrary depths. In the Q&A session, you need to specify the outermost decorator first, followed by any
nested decorators, and finally the original geometry being decorated.

For this tutorial, you will create a spiral galaxy model by applying the spiral structure decorator to a
double-exponential disk geometry. Immediately after selecting a "built-in geometry" source component, choose the
spiral structure decorator, and then choose the exponential disk geometry as the geometry to be decorated with spiral
arms. \c SKIRT then requests the properties of the exponential disk geometry, followed by the properties of the
decorator. This ordering is a consequence of the nesting mentioned above.

For the stellar exponential disk, specify a scale length of 1800 pc and a scale height of 300 pc, without an inner
cavity. For the stellar spiral structure, specify 2 arms, a pitch angle of 20 degrees, a radius zero point of 300 pc, a
phase zero-point of zero degrees, and a perturbation weight of 0.5.

\verbatim

      3. Neutral: λ L_λ = ν L_ν
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 1
 ? Enter the specific luminosity at the given wavelength ]0 Lsun/micron,∞ Lsun/micron[: 1e11
\endverbatim

Because this tutorial simulation includes just a single wavelength, the emission spectrum of the source does not really
matter; we just need to specify the luminosity at that wavelength. However, the Q&A questions handle the general case
where both the emission spectrum and some normalization for the luminosity of each source must be specified.

For this tutorial, (arbitrarily) select a black-body spectrum with the default temperature. Then select normalization
through the specific luminosity at a given wavelength, with a "per unit of wavelength" luminosity unit style. Finally,
specify a luminosity at \f$\lambda=0.55~\mu\text{m}\f$ (the wavelength specified previously) of \f$L_\lambda =
10^11~\text{L}_\odot/\mu\text{m}\f$.

\endverbatim

The geometry of the spatial dust distribution can be configured in a very similar way. Select a "built-in geometry"
medium component, choose the spiral structure decorator, and then choose the exponential disk geometry as the geometry
to be decorated. For the dust exponential disk, specify a scale length of 2000 pc and a scale height of 150 pc, without
a central cavity. For the dust spiral structure, specify 2 arms, a pitch angle of 20 degrees, a radius zero point of
300 pc, and a perturbation weight of 0.5. In other words, for this tutorial, the dust spiral structure is identical to
the stellar spiral structure.

\endverbatim

For this tutorial, the optical depth of the dust in the model is more important than the precise dust properties.
Select the default mean interstellar dust properties with an optical depth normalization along the Z-axis at the
wavelength of the simulation; specify \f$\tau(0.55\,\mu\textrm{m})=2\f$.

\endverbatim

Consider the spatial discretization of a dust density distribution with a lot of three-dimensional structure and a
large dynamic range. To obtain a rule of thumb for the resolution of a regular dust grid (i.e. a grid with fixed grid
points in each dimension), one could posit that the projection of a grid cell on an instrument should have roughly the
same size as a detector pixel. For a detector with only \f$512\times 512\f$ pixels, this would lead to \f$512^3\approx
1.3\times 10^8\f$ grid cells. However one can usually do a lot better than this. The goal is to minimize the total
number of cells (and thus the simulation run time) while still producing the appropriate simulation results. To this
end, it is generally best to place smaller cells in high-density areas (and in areas where the density changes
rapidly), and larger cells in low-density areas. The adaptive grids offered by \c SKIRT serve this purpose. However,
you still need to properly configure the heuristics used by these grids to place their cells.

For example, the octtree grid recursively subdivides the cuboidal domain into 8 cuboidal subcells until each cell
satisfies certain criteria, or until a maximum level of subdivision has been reached. The grid can take into account
several other criteria other than the maximum level. The most basic criterion subdivides cells until the dust mass in
each cell is smaller than a given fraction of the total dust mass in the grid. The other criteria look at the optical
depth through the dust across each cell and at the dust density dispersion in each cell (a measure of the gradient in
the dust density).

To start your study of adaptive grids in this tutorial, select a tree-based grid with a domain range of [-10 kpc, 10
kpc] in both the x and y directions, a range of [-1 kpc, 1 kpc] in the z direction. Leave the other parameters to their
default values with the exception of the maximum fraction of dust mass contained in each dust cell, which you should
set to a more relaxed value of \f$10^{-5}\f$. You will study the effect of these parameter values in the second part of
this tutorial.

\endverbatim

Configure two instruments that output the total flux in every pixel, one at an inclination of 0 degrees (face-on) and
one at an inclination of 90 degrees. The azimuth angles can remain at the default value of zero. The distance of the
instrument to the model affects all fluxes with the same factor; use a value of your liking (for example 10 Mpc). For
the face-on view, specify a field of view of \f$20\times 20\f$ kpc centered on the origin, with \f$512\times 512\f$
pixels. For the edge-on view, the vertical size and number of pixels can be reduced to, say, half of the horizontal
size. For this tutorial, there is no reason to record flux components separately.

\subsection TutorialGridsSpiralRun Running the simulation

After all questions have been answered, \c SKIRT writes out the resulting ski file and terminates. Start \c SKIRT
again, this time specifying the name of the new \em ski file on the command line, to actually perform the simulation.

The output files for this tutorial are similar to those already described for a previous tutorial (see \ref
TutorialBasicsMonoOutput and \ref TutorialBasicsPanOutput). Because the geometry in this simulation is truly
three-dimensional (i.e. it has no axial or spherical symmetries), there are now three cuts through the dust density
(one along each of the coordinate planes) rather than two.


\section TutorialGridsOptim Optimizing the spatial grid

\subsection TutorialGridsOptimAna Initial analysis

Open the file \c ArmedSpiralTree_cnv_convergence.dat in a text editor, and note the differences between the input and
gridded values for the total dust mass and for the optical depth along each of the coordinate axes. The input values
are calculated from the analytical expressions for the geometry of the configured dust medium; the actual values are
determined by summing over the spatial grid cells. With the parameter settings given in the previous section, the
discrepancy in the total dust mass is about 3%, but the optical depths show errors of up to 20%, which is not
acceptable. These discrepancies are caused by a combination of two effects.

First, an exponential disk distribution extends to infinity in all directions, while the dust grid domain is
necessarily finite. Thus, a portion of the dust distribution is cut off. To alleviate this issue, you can enlarge the
dust grid, but that will adversely affect the total number of cells needed to resolve the dust distribution.
Alternatively, you can apply cutoffs to the exponential dust distribution (by specifying these values in the geometry
configuration using options that are hidden at the \em Basic user level), which will redistribute the clipped dust mass
over the remaining part of the disk. Because the discrepancy for the total dust mass is limited in this case, it seems
that this effect is limited, so no action is required.

The second cause underlying a convergence discrepancy is the discretization of the theoretical dust distribution by the
cells in the spatial grid. Each cell has a uniform density determined by randomly sampling the density over the cell's
volume. If there are too many large cells in areas with substantial density gradients, a discrepancy in the discretized
densities will result. To help evaluate this issue, open the theoretical and gridded density cuts along the horizontal
coordinate plane (\c ArmedSpiralTree_dns_dust_t_xy.fits and \c ArmedSpiralTree_dns_dust_g_xy.fits) and along one of the
vertical planes (e.g. \c ArmedSpiralTree_dns_dust_t_xz.fits and \c ArmedSpiralTree_dns_dust_g_xz.fits) in a FITS file
viewer such as DS9. Alternatively you can plot the density cuts using the following \c PTS command:

\verbatim
pts plot_density_cuts . --prefix=ArmedSpiralTree
\endverbatim

It is worth noting that these cuts are always generated with a fixed pixel resolution of 1024 by 1024, regardless of
the actual domain size. This why the vertical cuts look stretched out: the vertical size is 10 times smaller but is
covered by the same number of pixels. In any case, it is immediately obvious in the cuts that the current grid (with
the parameters given in the previous section) does not properly resolve the model's density distribution, especially
near the center of the model.

It is a good idea to also review the surface brightness maps produced by the instruments, even if only to verify that
the instrument parameters were entered properly. Even with this limited grid, the mock observations show the expected
overall form. In view of the limited grid resolution, however, we can't trust the results, especially in the central
areas of the model.

Now turn your attention to the simulation log messages (in the console or in the generated log file). During and
immediately after constructing the octtree, \c SKIRT reports some statistics on the structure of the tree, similar to
the following. The exact values will differ because the dust mass in a tree node is obtain by randomly sampling the
density distribution.

\verbatim
   ...

   Subdividing level 1: 8 nodes
   Subdividing level 2: 64 nodes
   Subdividing level 3: 512 nodes
   Subdividing level 4: 3568 nodes
   Subdividing level 5: 19736 nodes
   Finished construction of the spatial tree grid
   Number of cells at each level in the tree hierarchy:
     Level  0:        0 (  0.0%)  |
     Level  1:        0 (  0.0%)  |
     Level  2:        0 (  0.0%)  |
     Level  3:       66 (  0.1%)  |
     Level  4:     1101 (  1.3%)  |

     Level  6:    76240 ( 87.0%)  |********************
     TOTAL   :    87613 (100.0%)
   ...
\endverbatim

In this context, the term \em node indicates any node in the tree, including \em intermediate nodes that are subdivided
and \em leaf nodes that are not subdivided any further. Once the tree has been constructed, the leaf nodes form the
actual spatial cells of the grid.

The "Subdiving" messages are intended as a progress log. They list the number of nodes present in the tree as it has
been constructed up to the indicated level. This can be helpful while fine-tuning tree construction parameters: if the
number of nodes becomes excessively high, you may decide to abort the \c SKIRT process so that you can adjust the
parameters and try again.

Once tree construction has finished, \c SKIRT logs the number of actual cells (i.e. \em leaf nodes) at each subdivision
level, and it draws a rough histogram of the number of cells (asterisk bars on the horizontal axis) as a function of
subdivision level (vertical axis). Level 0 corresponds to the complete spatial domain. For this simulation, there
cannot be any cells at the most shallow subdivision levels (0 through 2) because the configuration specifies a minimum
level of grid refinement of 2. The list ends at level 6 because the configuration specifies a maximum level of grid
refinement of 6. It appears that most of the cells are at level 6, i.e. the deepest allowed subdivision level. This
implies that the subdivision criteria (in this case the maximum mass fraction) are not satisfied for the majority of
the dust cells. In other words, the octtree configuration is not well balanced for this particular model.

Before optimizing the dust grid, it is worth revisiting the convergence file \c ArmedSpiralTree_cnv_convergence.dat. At
the end of that file, you will find optical depth statistics similar to the following (again, the exact values will
differ because of the random density sampling process):

\verbatim
Optical depth of cell diagonal at 0.55 micron
  Largest: 2.73369
  Average: 0.0779654
  90% <  : 0.180564
\endverbatim

These statistics will come in handy for setting the maximum optical depth criterion as described at the end of the
following section.

\subsection TutorialGridsOptimAdj Adjusting the octtree grid parameters

The first step is to set appropriate minimum and maximum subdvision levels. The dust mass in a grid cell (or
equivalently, its average dust density) is estimated by sampling the theoretical dust density in a number of random
locations across the cell volume. In low-density regions of the model, it can happen that a dust concentration in one
corner of a large grid cell is insufficiently sampled to trigger the maximum-mass-fraction criterion, leaving the
overly large cell in place. To avoid this from happening, it is often wise to slightly increase the minimum subdvision
level to a value of 4.

At the other end of the scale, one could use the rule of thumb mentioned earlier: the grid cells must be allowed to
become at least as small as an instrument pixel (after parallel projection). Unfortunately, this provides only an upper
limit on the cell size. The real question is whether the small-scale dust structure is sufficiently resolved in the
grid to enable accurate calculation of the radiation field. For a semi-smooth analytical model such as the one studied
in this tutorial, it seems reasonable to settle for an extra factor of two. With 512 pixels along the instrument field
of view, this leads to a maximum subdvision level of \f$\log_2(2*512)=10\f$.

Open the \c ArmedSpiralTree.ski file in a text editor and locate the specification of the spatial grid:

\verbatim
<grid type="SpatialGrid">
    <PolicyTreeSpatialGrid ... treeType="OctTree">
        <policy type="TreePolicy">
            <DensityTreePolicy minLevel="2" maxLevel="6" maxDustFraction="1e-5" maxDustOpticalDepth="0" .../>
        </policy>
    </PolicyTreeSpatialGrid>
</grid>
\endverbatim

Adjust the minimum and maximum subdvision levels to \c minLevel="4" and \c maxLevel="10". Rerun the simulation and
study the log file to evaluate the effect on the distribution of the dust cells over subdivision levels.

\note While optimizing the octtree grid following the guidance of this section, you may want to temporarily set the
number of photon packets launched to zero (by changing the value of the \c numPackets property at the start of the ski
file). Alternatively, you can type \<Ctrl\>-C in the terminal window to abort \c SKIRT as soon as it starts shooting
photon packets.

With these settings the grid has slightly over 330,000 cells. There are no cells on levels 9 and 10, however. This
implies that the maximum dust mass fraction criterion is too relaxed. Change this setting in the ski file from
\f$10^{-5}\f$ to \f$10^{-6}\f$ and rerun the simulation. Now the grid has more than 3.2 million cells, most of which
are on levels 8 and 9. This looks like a well-balanced grid, and for a more realistic model with a lot of small-scale
clumpiness it might very well be an appropriate grid. For this tutorial (with simulations running on laptops) it is
acceptable to relax the maximum mass fraction again to an intermediate value. In a more realistic research setting, one
would compare the simulation results for various grids until convergence is reached. For this tutorial, you can simply
pick the value of \f$5\times10^{-6}\f$. This leads to a grid with about 650,000 cells, none of which are on level 10.

You can now further fine-tune this grid by also imposing a maximum optical depth criterion on each cell (measured
across the cell diagonal). Open the convergence file and locate the optical depth statistics for your most recent grid
(with min/max levels 4 and 10 and max mass fraction \f$5\times10^{-6}\f$). Most cells have an optical depth lower than
0.22, and some cells haven an optical depth of up to 0.63. It is beneficial for the grid quality to further subdivide
the relatively small number of cells with the largest optical depths.

Set the maximum dust optical depth criterion in the ski file to a value of 0.3 (at a wavelength of
\f$0.55\,\mu\textrm{m}\f$) and rerun the simulation. The grid now has about 900,000 grid cells, of which more than
100,000 are on level 10. In other words, the optical depth criterion added more than 30% extra cells to the grid, so
that the cell optical depth distribution has a much smaller tail. Interestingly, looking at the statistics again, the
largest optical depth is above the maximum optical depth criterion. This might indicate that some of the cells on level
10 have an optical depth above the maximum criterion, but could not be further subdivided because they are already at
the deepest allowed level. However, this is not the case in this simulation, as can be easily verified by raising the
maximum subdivision level. So what is going on?

In \c SKIRT, the cell mass calculations used for making subdivision decisions while constructing the tree are
completely seperate from the calculations that set the cell mass in the final grid. Because the calculations sample the
theoretical densities at a different set of randomly chosen locations, the results are never quite identical (except
for uniform theoretical densities). The accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of random samples, at the
cost of increased setup times, by changing the value of the \c numDensitySamples property of the \c MediumSystem.

The third criterion, imposing a maximum dust density dispersion, is intended to force cell subdivisions along steep
gradients in the dust density. It is applicable to geometries with clumps or dust walls that don't line up with the
coordinate axes. It is not covered any further in this tutorial.

If you have \c PTS installed, and you configured the \c SpatialGridPlotProbe in the simulation, you can visualize the
spatial grid structure with the following command:

\verbatim
pts plot_grids . --prefix=ArmedSpiralTree
\endverbatim

This command creates PDF files with cuts along the coordinate planes through a wireframe version of the grid such as
the following (for the galactic plane of the tutorial simulation):

At the lower subdivision levels, the individual cells are visible. At the higher subdivision levels, the denser cells
structure translates to levels of grayscale. The command also creates a three-dimensional view of the wireframe grid,
which is meaningful only when the grid has very few cells (with too many cells the result is just a black blob).

As a test of your final octtree grid with 900,000 cells, you might want to run the simulation with more photon packets
(e.g. \f$10^7\f$) and review the surface brigthness frames produced by the instruments. You could also add extra
instruments at other inclinations (duplicate one of the instrument specifications in the ski file, and adjust
the values for the new instrument's attributes \c instrumentName and \c inclination).

\subsection TutorialGridsOptimVoro1 About unstructured grids

Hierarchical grids such as the octtree seem to be an obvious choice. It is fairly straightforward to construct an
appropriate grid for any density field, and it is easy to calculate a straight path through the grid, since the
boundaries of the cuboidal cells are lined up with the coordinate axes and each cell has a limited number of neighbors.

Hierarchical grids also have drawbacks, however. First of all, for a given density field and required resolution, an
octtree grid may not be the kind of grid with the least number of cells. To illustrate this, consider a density field
defined by a set of smoothed particles. An octree grid constructed such that each cell encloses at most one particle
usually has over three times more cells than there are particles; i.e., two out of three cells are empty. In contrast,
an unstructured grid based on a Voronoi tessellation of the spatial domain, using the given particles as generating
sites, has exactly the same number of cells as there are particles. While not an issue in many situations, minimizing
the number of cells is sometimes crucial. For example, consider a panchromatic radiative transfer simulation involving
small dust grains in non-LTE conditions. Because each cell stores radiation field data per wavelength bin, memory
requirements are substantial. Moreover, the simulation run time may very well be dominated by the calculation of the
non-LTE heating and re-emission of the dust grains in each cell. In this case, both memory usage and run time scale
roughly linearly with the number of cells.

Furthermore, radiative transfer simulations frequently serve to predict the observable properties of artificial systems
resulting from hydrodynamical simulations. Some recent simulation codes introduce a new scheme that employs a moving
mesh based on a Voronoi tessellation of the spatial domain. This new scheme is claimed to combine the best features of
SPH and the traditional Eulerian approach, and it is becoming increasingly popular. While the output from a moving mesh
code can be re-gridded to a hierarchical grid to perform radiative transfer, the resampling process unavoidably
introduces inaccuracies and represents additional overhead. Thus it may be preferable to perform both aspects of the
simulation (hydrodynamics and radiative transfer) on the same grid.

Finally, calculating a straight path through a 3D Voronoi grid is less daunting than it may seem, so that it becomes
possible to perform accurate and reasonably efficient radiative transfer on unstructured Voronoi grids.

\subsection TutorialGridsOptimVoro2 Experimenting with a Voronoi grid

To avoid overwriting your octtree simulation results, copy the ski file \c ArmedSpiralTree.ski to another file called,
for example, \c ArmedSpiralVoro.ski. Open this new file in a text editor and replace the spatial grid specification by
the following:

\verbatim
<grid type="SpatialGrid">
    <VoronoiMeshSpatialGrid minX="-1e4 pc" maxX="1e4 pc" minY="-1e4 pc" maxY="1e4 pc" minZ="-1e3 pc" maxZ="1e3 pc"
                            policy="DustDensity" numSites="200000" relaxSites="false"/>
</grid>
\endverbatim

Using these parameters, \c SKIRT will construct a Voronoi grid with 200,000 cells. The locations of the seed points or
\em sites will be sampled from the theoretical dust density distribution. In other words, on average, the cells
will be smaller in high-density regions and larger in low-density regions.

With this number of cells, the results of the \c SpatialGridPlotProbe are essentially meaningless (the plot becomes
a black blob) and take quite some time to generate, so it is best to remove this probe from the probe list (near
the end of the ski file).

After saving the above changes, run this new simulation. Building a Voronoi grid takes some time (even for only 200,000
cells), in part because the process is not parallelized in the current \c SKIRT implementation, but this only affects
the setup phase. More importantly, shooting photons through a Voronoi grid is about three times slower than through a
(highly optimized) octtree grid. The Voronoi grid may not be a big win for this monochromatic tutorial simulation, but
it might still be beneficial for more complex panchromatic simulations.

Evaluate the results of the simulation, following more or less the steps described in section \ref
TutorialGridsOptimAna. When comparing the simulation results between the octtree grid (with 850,000 cells) and the
Voronoi grid (with 200,000 cells), take note of the following points.

The dust density discretization with the Voronoi grid is not numerically converged. The convergence metrics show
optical depth discrepencies of over 10%. Probably as a result of this, the observed flux density in the central edge-on
regions differs somewhat between the two simulations. However, the Voronoi grid has four times fewer cells! Given
sufficient time and computing resources, you might want to increase the number of cells until the simulation results
reach convergence.

All octtree cells have the same form factor as the complete domain of the grid, in this case rather flat (the height
is 10 times smaller than the width), while the Voronoi cells don't have any such predisposition. This gives the octtree
an advantage over the Voronoi grid in resolving the central regions of the model. More intelligent placement of the
Voronoi sites might alleviate this issue.

\c SKIRT already offers a few different schemes for placing the Voronoi sites randomly (uniform, with a steep central
peak, according to dust density) or deterministically (at SPH particle locations, loaded from file). More research is
needed in this area to develop heuristics for optimal placement.
