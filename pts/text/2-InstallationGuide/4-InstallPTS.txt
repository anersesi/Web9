\page InstallPTS Installing the PTS code

\section InstallPTSclone Getting the source code

To work with \c PTS you need to copy the source code to your local file system. First create a directory hierarchy that
will hold the \c PTS source code and run-time information. The top-level directory can have any name (for example \c
PTS) and can be located anywhere (for example in your home directory), but the subdirectories should be named as
indicated below. Execute the following commands in a Terminal window to create the \c PTS directory in your \em home
folder.

    cd
    mkdir PTS
    cd PTS
    mkdir run pts

The \c PTS source code is available from the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS9">public PTS GitHub repository</a>.
While any user can freely retrieve the code from this repository (even anonymously), only the \c SKIRT team has write
access to it. To obtain the code, simply type the following commands in a Terminal window:

    cd ~/PTS
    git clone https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS9.git pts

To <em>update</em> your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned
it, use:

    cd ~/PTS/pts
    git pull

If you plan to make code contributions, you should create an account at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>,
fork the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS9">PTS repository</a> and then clone this forked repository. This allows
you to push modifications to your own fork and initiate a pull request when you want to contribute the changes to the
project. Refer to <a href="../root/_contributing.html">Contributing to the <tt>SKIRT</tt> project</a> for more
information.


\section InstallPTSalias Configuring PTS paths and aliases

It is important that your Python install can automatically locate the \c PTS source code so that it can execute \c PTS
commands and import \c PTS modules regardless of the current directory. Furthermore it is handy to provide an alias so
that you can easily access \c PTS from the command line.

To accomplish this, you will have to add the following lines to your login script (<tt>.profile</tt> or
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or equivalent if you are using a shell other than \c bash):

    export PYTHONPATH=~/PTS
    alias pts="python -m pts.do"

Note that the first line must be adjusted if your \c PTS directory resides in a different place or has another name.
After you save the login script, you must log out an log back in (or open another Terminal window) for the changes to
take effect.


\section InstallPTStest Testing the PTS installation

You can run a basic test of your \c PTS installation by entering the following command line:

    pts try me

which should produce a response similar to the following:

    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043   Starting admin/try_do...
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043   Command line arguments are:
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043     Fixed string:    me
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043     Optional string: PTS is great
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043     Float number:    3.14
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043     Integer number:  7
    03/06/2019 16:52:05.043   Finished admin/try_do.
